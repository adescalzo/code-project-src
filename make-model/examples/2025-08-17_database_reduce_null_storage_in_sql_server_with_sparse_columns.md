# Reduce NULL Storage in SQL Server with Sparse Columns

# Reduce NULL Storage in SQL Server with Sparse Columns

SQL Server provides Sparse Columns to efficiently store NULL values while minimizing storage consumption. Sparse columns are ideal when a significant percentage of rows contain NULL values in a column.

## 1. What Are Sparse Columns?

Sparse columns are ordinary columns optimized for NULL storage. When a column is declared as SPARSE, it does not consume storage for NULL values, making them beneficial when a large number of rows have NULLs.

*   **Benefits of Sparse Columns:**
    *   Saves storage by not allocating space for NULL values.
    *   Reduces I/O operations and improves performance for sparse datasets.
    *   Supports filtered indexes for better query performance.
*   **Drawbacks of Sparse Columns:**
    *   Non-NULL values take up more space than regular columns.
    *   It cannot be used with:
        *   Text, Ntext, Image, Timestamp.
        *   User-defined data types.
        *   Computed columns.
        *   Default values (unless explicitly specified in an insert).
        *   CHECK constraints (except NULL constraints).

## 2. Declaring Sparse Columns

To use sparse columns, declare them with the SPARSE attribute.

**Example.** Creating a Table with Sparse Columns.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    PhoneNumber VARCHAR(20) SPARSE NULL,
    Address NVARCHAR(255) SPARSE NULL
);
```

PhoneNumber and Address will not consume storage when NULL.

When storing non-NULL values, they use more storage than regular columns.

## 3. Storage Considerations

The impact on storage depends on the data type.

*   **For NULL values:** Storage savings are significant.
*   **For Non-NULL values:** Sparse columns require an additional 4 bytes.

### When to Use Sparse Columns?

*   When at least 20-40% of values are NULL, sparse columns save space.
*   If NULLs are less frequent, regular columns are more efficient.

Example of Storage Cost for INT Data Type.

## 4. Using Sparse Columns with Column Sets

SQL Server provides Column Sets to handle sparse columns dynamically.

**Example.** Using Column Set for Dynamic Queries.

```sql
CREATE TABLE EmployeeData (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    PhoneNumber VARCHAR(20) SPARSE NULL,
    Address NVARCHAR(255) SPARSE NULL,
    AdditionalData XML COLUMN_SET FOR ALL_SPARSE_COLUMNS
);
```

AdditionalData (XML) aggregates all sparse column values into a single XML column dynamically.

### Retrieving Data Using Column Set

```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, AdditionalData FROM EmployeeData;
```

The Column Set simplifies handling dynamic attributes.

## 5. Querying Sparse Columns Efficiently

Use Filtered Indexes to optimize queries on sparse columns.

**Example.** Creating a Filtered Index.

```sql
CREATE INDEX IX_Employees_PhoneNumber
ON Employees(PhoneNumber)
WHERE PhoneNumber IS NOT NULL;
```

This improves query performance for non-NULL sparse column searches.

**Example.** Query with Index Utilization.

```sql
SELECT Name, PhoneNumber
FROM Employees
WHERE PhoneNumber IS NOT NULL;
```

The filtered index ensures efficient lookups.

## 6. Checking Sparse Column Storage Space

You can analyze storage savings using sys.dm\_db\_index\_physical\_stats.

Check Space Savings.

```sql
SELECT name, is_sparse, max_length
FROM sys.columns
WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID('Employees');
```

This shows which columns are SPARSE.

## 7. When NOT to Use Sparse Columns

Avoid sparse columns when:

*   NULL values are less than 20-40% of total rows.
*   The column is part of frequent aggregations.
*   Additional 4-byte overhead is unacceptable.

## 8. Test Tables with sparse and without parse columns

Create two tables as below.

Add random data in both tables.

Check Table space.

Sparse columns in SQL Server are a powerful way to optimize NULL storage, reduce space usage, and improve performance. They work best when a high percentage of values are NULL and can be efficiently queried using filtered indexes and column sets.
