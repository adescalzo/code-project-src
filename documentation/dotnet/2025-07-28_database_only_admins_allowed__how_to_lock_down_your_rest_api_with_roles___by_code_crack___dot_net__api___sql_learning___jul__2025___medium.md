Only Admins Allowed (Created in ChatGPT)

## Benefits of Role-Based Access:

*   **_Protects sensitive APIs_**
*   **_Shares user responsibilities_**
*   **_Prevents unnecessary access_**
*   **_Enables compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, or SOC2_**

# Real API Example

Let‚Äôs say you have created an API where users can be deleted via request:

DELETE /api/users/123  
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1...

You want only users with the ‚Äú**Admin**‚Äù role to be able to do this. Then you need to verify the user‚Äôs role from the **JWT token** and provide access control.

# Implementation Guide (ASP.NET Core Example)

## Step 1: Add Role Claim to JWT Token

var claims = new List<Claim>  
{  
    new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, user.Username),  
    new Claim(ClaimTypes.Role, "Admin") // <-- Roll added here  
};

## Step 2: Implement Role-Based Authorization in the API

\[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")\]  
\[HttpDelete("api/users/{id}")\]  
public IActionResult DeleteUser(int id)  
{  
    \_userService.Delete(id);  
    return Ok();  
}

If the user‚Äôs role is not ‚Äú**Admin**‚Äù, they will not have access to this endpoint.

# What if you use Node.js?

## Express + JWT + Middleware example:

function authorizeRoles(...roles) {  
  return (req, res, next) => {  
    const user = req.user;  
    if (!roles.includes(user.role)) {  
      return res.status(403).json({ message: "Access denied" });  
    }  
    next();  
  };  
}

Usage:

app.delete('/api/users/:id', authenticateJWT, authorizeRoles('Admin'), deleteUser);

# Keep an Audit Log

*   Who accessed which API and when?
*   Which role was used to access it?
*   What sensitive actions were taken?

Along with Role-Based Access, logging is also important.

In today‚Äôs era, API security is not limited to passwords or JWT tokens. If you want a secure, scalable, and compliance-ready REST API, Role-Based Authorization is a must.

Clearly define each resource ‚Äî  
**Who can see it? Who can edit it? Who can delete it?**
