summary: |
  This article introduces C# 14's new "Extension Members" feature, positioning it as a powerful evolution beyond traditional extension methods. The author explains the limitations of old extension methods, such as the inability to add properties or operators, and demonstrates how extension members overcome these issues. Through practical C# code examples, the piece illustrates how to implement properties, static members, and cleaner method extensions. It highlights that this feature promotes more natural API design, improves code readability, and simplifies refactoring, making extensions feel like first-class citizens of a type.

# .NET 10‚Äôs Most Powerful Feature Isn‚Äôt What You Think | by Gulam Ali H. | Aug, 2025 | Stackademic

# .NET 10‚Äôs Most Powerful Feature Isn‚Äôt What You Think

## It‚Äôs C# 14‚Äôs Extension Members, and they‚Äôre about to change everything.

# Introduction:

You know that feeling when something you‚Äôve been using for years suddenly feels‚Ä¶ incomplete? That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve always felt about extension methods. They were clever, sure, but they never truly _belonged_. They were hacks wearing a clean syntax mask.

C# 14 just fixed that with **Extension Members**. And I‚Äôm calling it now: this is the best feature in the entire release.

Let me show you why.

# Extension Methods Were Always Half-Baked

I never hated extension methods. They were useful. But let‚Äôs be honest, they always felt like the language was saying:

> _‚ÄúHey, we know you want to evolve APIs without touching the source, so here‚Äôs a static method disguised as something cooler. Don‚Äôt look too closely.‚Äù_

And you did look closely, didn‚Äôt you?

*   No properties.
*   No operators.
*   No logical grouping of related extensions beyond awkward static classes.
*   They never felt like they _belonged_ to the type.

Enter **Extension Members**. The grown-up version of what extension methods always wanted to be.

# Example 1: The Classic `ToObservable` Rewrite

If you have used MVVM, with **WPF**, **Xamarin**, **MAUI,** etc, you‚Äôve probably written this a hundred times:

```csharp
public static class ObservableExtensions  
{  
    public static ObservableCollection<T> ToObservable<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source)  
        => new ObservableCollection<T>(source);  
}
```

It works, but it feels weird; it does not feel like an extension to an existing type, and now here‚Äôs the **Extension Member** way:

```csharp
public static class EnumerableExtensions  
{  
    extension(IEnumerable<T> collection)  
    {  
        public ObservableCollection<T> ToObservable()  
            => new ObservableCollection<T>(collection);  
    }  
}
```

See the difference? No clutter. No weird ‚Äústatic method pretending to be a real member.‚Äù It _feels_ like `IEnumerable<T>` owns this behavior. If you have used Swift at any point in your career, you probably relate to this feature big time, and I understand, it‚Äôs just ü§å

# Syntax Snapshot: Extension Members at a Glance

If you want to steal the syntax:

```csharp
public static class NameOfExtensionClass  
{  
    extension(YourType obj)  
    {  
        // Methods, properties, operators, even nested types  
    }  
}
```

Yes, you read that right, **properties** and **operators** are allowed.

# Example 2: Adding Properties That Actually Make Sense

Ever wanted a clean way to check if a collection is empty without writing `!collection.Any()` or `collection.Count == 0` everywhere?

With extension members:

```csharp
public static class CollectionExtensions  
{  
    extension(ICollection<T> collection)  
    {  
       public bool IsEmpty => this.Count == 0;  
    }  
}
```

Usage:

```csharp
if (myList.IsEmpty)  
{  
    // Finally reads the way it should  
}
```

This is the kind of thing extension methods could never do cleanly; now it feels like a natural part of the type system.

# Example 3: Static Extension Members

You can even add static members to types you don‚Äôt own:

```csharp
public static class DateTimeExtensions  
{  
    extension(DateTime)  
    {  
        public static DateTime UnixEpoch => new DateTime(1970, 1, 1);  
    }  
}
```

# Migrating Existing Code

Got a whole library of static extension methods? Migrate it like this:

**Before:**

```csharp
public static class DateTimeExtensions  
{  
    public static bool IsWeekend(this DateTime date)  
        => date.DayOfWeek is DayOfWeek.Saturday or DayOfWeek.Sunday;  
}
```

**After:**

```csharp
public static class DateTimeExtensions  
{  
    extension(DateTime dateTime)  
    {  
        public bool IsWeekend => dateTime.DayOfWeek is DayOfWeek.Saturday or DayOfWeek.Sunday;  
    }  
}
```

Cleaner. More discoverable. Easier to maintain.

# How It Works Under the Hood

For the curious, here‚Äôs the simple version:

*   They don‚Äôt modify the original type.
*   The compiler and metadata treat them like ‚Äúattached‚Äù members.
*   Tools (like IntelliSense) display them as if they belong to the type.
*   Underneath, it‚Äôs still safe and separate, just _smarter_.

Want me to deep dive into the mechanics? Drop a comment, and I might do a dedicated post.

# Limitations You Should Know

They‚Äôre new, so:

*   No runtime magic, they‚Äôre compile-time only.
*   You can‚Äôt add fields or mess with private members.
*   Tooling outside of modern IDEs might lag a bit in support (for now).

But honestly? These are minor trade-offs for what we‚Äôre getting.

# Why This Is My Favorite Feature

Extension Members finally make extensions feel like **first-class citizens**. They make APIs evolve naturally. They reduce clutter. They make code read as if it were always designed that way.

This isn‚Äôt just syntactic sugar. It‚Äôs the feature that makes me excited to refactor old codebases, not something I say often.

# Conclusion

Extension Members aren‚Äôt just a shiny new syntax. They‚Äôre a course correction. They take what extension methods started and finish the job. Cleaner APIs, discoverable features, fewer utility classes lurking in random namespaces, it all just feels‚Ä¶ right.

That‚Äôs why this is my favorite C# 14 feature. It doesn‚Äôt make you rethink how you write _some_ of your code. It makes you rethink how you design **all** of it.

So now it‚Äôs your turn: **What‚Äôs the first thing you‚Äôd refactor into an extension type?** Would you go all-in and migrate your helpers, or test the waters with one killer property? Tell me in the comments, I want to see what you come up with.
