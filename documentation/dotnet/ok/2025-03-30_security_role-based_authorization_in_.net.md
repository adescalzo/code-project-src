summary: |
  This article explains role-based authorization, a security mechanism that grants access based on predefined user roles rather than individual permissions. It demonstrates how to implement this in a .NET application, building upon existing JWT authentication. The guide covers defining User, Role, and UserRole entities, configuring them with Entity Framework Core, and updating business logic for user registration and login to include roles in JWT claims. Finally, it shows how to apply authorization to API endpoints using the `[Authorize]` attribute for controllers and `RequireAuthorization` for Minimal APIs, ensuring users only access authorized resources.

When building applications that handle user interactions, implementing proper authorization is a common requirement. Without it, users could access sensitive data or perform actions beyond their permissions, leading to unwanted behavior. To address this, applications need to control access based on user responsibilities. The simplest way to achieve this is role-based authorization.

## Role-based authorization

**Role-based authorization** is a security mechanism that grants access based on predefined **roles** rather than managing **permissions** for individual users. Instead of assigning permissions to each user separately, users are grouped into roles, with each role defining a specific set of permissions.

![Diagram illustrating role-based authorization, showing users mapped to roles (Admin, Seller), which then grant access to specific resources (Financial Data, User Management, Products, Sales Data).](https://coekcx.github.io/BlogImages/images/role-based-authorization-diagram.png)

When a user logs in, the system determines their role and enforces access restrictions accordingly. This ensures that users can only interact with resources necessary for their responsibilities, improving security and maintainability.

## Prerequisites

Before enforcing role-based authorization, authentication must be in place. In this example, we'll use **JWT authentication** in our API and include roles as claims within the JWT to manage authorization. If you're not familiar with how to implement it, check out this guide: [JWT Authentication](https://www.nikolatech.net/blogs/implement-jwt-authentication-in-dotnet)

## Entities

With authentication set up, the **User** entity should look like this:

```csharp
public sealed class User
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }

    public string Email { get; set; }

    public string Password { get; set; }

    public string FirstName { get; set; }

    public string LastName { get; set; }

    public User(
        string email,
        string password,
        string firstName,
        string lastName)
    {
        Id = Guid.NewGuid();
        Email = email;
        Password = password;
        FirstName = firstName;
        LastName = lastName;
    }
}
```

Next step is to define **Role** entity, hereâ€™s a simple example of a Role entity:

```csharp
public sealed class Role
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    public string Name { get; set; }

    public Role(int id, string name)
    {
        Id = id;
        Name = name;
    }
}
```

For roles, the entity only needs an id and a name.

To be able to add and remove roles dynamically, we need to create a **UserRole** entity as well:

```csharp
public class UserRole
{
    public Guid UserId { get; set; }

    public int RoleId { get; set; }

    public User User { get; set; }

    public Role Role { get; set; }

    public UserRole(Guid userId, int roleId)
    {
        UserId = userId;
        RoleId = roleId;
    }
}
```

However, if dynamic role management is not needed, simply adding navigation properties between the User and Role tables will suffice, EF Core will automatically create UserRole table for you.

I will explicitly define UserRole table for this blog post, if role management is not needed in your use case, the code snippets will be very similar, with just a slight difference.

With the models in place, we can configure them and their relationships as follows:

```csharp
public sealed class RoleConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<Role>
{
    public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Role> builder)
    {
        builder.ToTable(TableNames.Roles);

        builder.HasKey(u => u.Id);

        builder.Property(u => u.Name)
            .IsRequired()
            .HasMaxLength(100);
    }
}
```

```csharp
public sealed class UserConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<User>
{
    public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<User> builder)
    {
        builder.ToTable(TableNames.Users);

        builder.HasKey(u => u.Id);

        builder.Property(u => u.Id)
            .IsRequired();

        builder.Property(u => u.Email)
            .IsRequired()
            .HasMaxLength(255);

        builder.Property(u => u.Password)
            .IsRequired()
            .HasMaxLength(100);

        builder.Property(u => u.FirstName)
            .IsRequired()
            .HasMaxLength(100);

        builder.Property(u => u.LastName)
            .IsRequired()
            .HasMaxLength(100);
    }
}
```

```csharp
public sealed class UserRoleConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<UserRole>
{
    public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<UserRole> builder)
    {
        builder.ToTable(TableNames.UserRoles);

        builder.HasKey(u => new { u.UserId, u.RoleId });

        builder.HasOne(u => u.User)
            .WithMany()
            .HasForeignKey(u => u.UserId)
            .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Cascade);

        builder.HasOne(u => u.Role)
            .WithMany()
            .HasForeignKey(u => u.RoleId)
            .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Cascade);
    }
}
```

## Updating Business Logic

Now that we set up the database, we can update business logic. Particularly, we should be interested in registration and login flows.

When registering a new user we need to create UserRole alongside creation of a new user:

```csharp
var user = new User(
    Guid.NewGuid(),
    request.Email,
    hashedPassword,
    request.FirstName,
    request.LastName,
    DateTime.UtcNow);

dbContext.Users.Add(user);

var userRole = new UserRole(user.Id, Role.SellerId);

dbContext.UserRoles.Add(userRole);

await dbContext.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken);
```

This will create a new user and a new user role with the seller role.

In the login flow, we have a **JwtGenerator** service responsible for generating JWT tokens:

```csharp
public interface IJwtGenerator
{
    Task<string> GenerateToken(Guid id, string email);
}
```

**GenerateToken** method should now need to fetch the users roles from the database and include them in the tokens claims:

```csharp
public async Task<string> Generate(Guid id, string email)
{
     var securityKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_jwtOptions.Secret));

     var credentials = new SigningCredentials(securityKey, SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256);

     var roleClaims = await _dbContext.UserRoles
         .Where(x => x.UserId == id)
         .Select(x => new Claim(ClaimTypes.Role, x.Role.Name))
         .ToListAsync();

     List<Claim> claims = [
         new(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub, id.ToString()),
         new(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Email, email)
     ];

     claims.AddRange(roleClaims);

     var tokenDescriptor = new SecurityTokenDescriptor
     {
         Subject = new ClaimsIdentity(claims),
         SigningCredentials = credentials,
         Issuer = _jwtOptions.Issuer,
         Audience = _jwtOptions.Audience,
         Expires = DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(_jwtOptions.ExpiresInMinutes)
     };

     var handler = new JsonWebTokenHandler();

     return handler.CreateToken(tokenDescriptor);
}
```

This implementation ensures that each JWT includes the necessary user details along with their assigned roles.

## Applying Authorization to Endpoints

The final step is applying roles to the endpoints.

If you're using controllers, you'll use the **Authorize** attribute. The Authorize attribute will enforce authentication and authorization for your controller or endpoint.

```csharp
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public sealed class ProductsController : BaseController
{
    [HttpPost]
    [Authorize(Roles = Role.Seller)]
    [ProducesResponseType(typeof(Guid), StatusCodes.Status200OK)]
    [ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status403Forbidden)]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Create(CreateProductRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var command = request.Adapt<CreateProductCommand>();

        var response = await Sender.Send(command, cancellationToken);

        return Ok(response);
    }

    // ...
}
```

Within the Authorize attribute, the Roles parameter further restricts access, allowing only users who have the specified roles. If a user is not authenticated or doesn't have the required role, they will receive a **403 Forbidden** response.

For Minimal APIs, the situation is similar. Instead of the Authorize attribute, the **RequireAuthorization** method is used to restrict access to users with the specified role:

```csharp
public sealed class CreateEndpoint : IEndpoint
{
    public void MapEndpoint(IEndpointRouteBuilder app)
    {
        app.MapPost("products/", async (ISender sender, CreateRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken) =>
        {
            var command = request.Adapt<CreateProductCommand>();

            var response = await sender.Send(command, cancellationToken);

            return Results.Ok(response.Value);
        })
        .WithTags(Tags.Products)
        .RequireAuthorization(policy => policy.RequireRole(Role.Seller));
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Role-based authorization is a powerful and efficient method of managing user access in your application. By associating users with specific roles, we can enforce access restrictions, ensuring that users only have access to the resources and actions theyâ€™re authorized to interact with.
