# 10 Costly HttpClient Mistakes in C#.NET (And How to Fix Them Like a Pro)

**Introduction:**

As a C#.NET developer, I‚Äôve seen firsthand how improper usage of `HttpClient` can lead to memory leaks, performance issues, and even security vulnerabilities. When I first started working with `HttpClient`, I made many of these mistakes myself. Over time, I learned how to avoid them and optimize my HTTP requests effectively. In this article, I'll walk you through ten costly mistakes developers make when using `HttpClient`‚Äîand more importantly, how you can fix them.

## üö® 1. Not Reusing the HttpClient Instance (Causing Socket Exhaustion)

## ‚ùå The Mistake:

Many developers create a new `HttpClient` instance for every request. This is a **bad practice** because each instance consumes system sockets, leading to **socket exhaustion** and degraded performance.

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetDataAsync(string url)
{
    using (var client = new HttpClient()) // ‚ùå Bad: New client per request
    {
        return await client.GetStringAsync(url);
    }
}
```

## ‚úÖ The Fix:

Instead, you should **reuse** a single instance of `HttpClient` across multiple requests. This way, you avoid excessive socket consumption.

```csharp
private static readonly HttpClient _httpClient = new HttpClient();

public async Task<string> GetDataAsync(string url)
{
    return await _httpClient.GetStringAsync(url);
}
```

For ASP.NET Core applications, the **recommended approach** is using `IHttpClientFactory` to manage `HttpClient` instances efficiently.

```csharp
public class MyService
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public MyService(HttpClient httpClient)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
    }

    public async Task<string> GetDataAsync(string url)
    {
        return await _httpClient.GetStringAsync(url);
    }
}
```

**Why?** This method ensures that `HttpClient` is correctly configured and avoids DNS resolution issues.

## üö® 2. Ignoring Timeouts (Risking Hanging Requests)

## ‚ùå The Mistake:

By default, `HttpClient` does **not** have a request timeout, meaning a request can hang indefinitely.

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetDataAsync(string url)
{
    return await _httpClient.GetStringAsync(url); // ‚ùå No timeout
}
```

## ‚úÖ The Fix:

Always set a timeout to prevent long-running requests from affecting your system.

```csharp
_httpClient.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10);
```

Or specify a timeout per request:

```csharp
var cts = new CancellationTokenSource(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));
var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync(url, cts.Token);
```

## üö® 3. Not Disposing HttpResponseMessage Properly

## ‚ùå The Mistake:

Failing to dispose of `HttpResponseMessage` can lead to **memory leaks**.

```csharp
var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync(url);
string data = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); // ‚ùå Forgot to dispose response
```

## ‚úÖ The Fix:

Always wrap `HttpResponseMessage` in a `using` statement.

```csharp
using (var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync(url))
{
    string data = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
}
```

## üö® 4. Blocking Calls with .Result or .Wait() (Causing Deadlocks)

## ‚ùå The Mistake:

Using `.Result` or `.Wait()` blocks the main thread, which can cause deadlocks in ASP.NET applications.

```csharp
public string GetData(string url)
{
    return _httpClient.GetStringAsync(url).Result; // ‚ùå Bad practice
}
```

## ‚úÖ The Fix:

Always use `async/await`.

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetDataAsync(string url)
{
    return await _httpClient.GetStringAsync(url);
}
```

## üö® 5. Not Handling HTTP Errors Properly

## ‚ùå The Mistake:

Many developers assume that `GetAsync()` always succeeds, but it can return 400 or 500 errors.

```csharp
var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync(url);
string data = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); // ‚ùå Ignoring status code
```

## ‚úÖ The Fix:

Always check `response.IsSuccessStatusCode`

```csharp
var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync(url);
if (!response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
{
    throw new Exception($"Request failed with status code {response.StatusCode}");
}

string data = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
```

## üö® 6. Forgetting to Set Default Headers

## ‚ùå The Mistake:

Not setting required headers like `Accept` or `User-Agent` can cause unexpected errors.

## ‚úÖ The Fix:

Set default headers on `HttpClient` before making requests.

```csharp
_httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("User-Agent", "MyApp");
_httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));
```

## üö® 7. Using HttpClient in a Synchronous Context

## ‚ùå The Mistake:

Calling `HttpClient` from synchronous code can cause **deadlocks**.

```csharp
public string GetData(string url)
{
    return _httpClient.GetStringAsync(url).Result; // ‚ùå Blocks thread
}
```

## ‚úÖ The Fix:

Use `async` all the way.

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetDataAsync(string url)
{
    return await _httpClient.GetStringAsync(url);
}
```

## üö® 8. Not Using IHttpClientFactory in ASP.NET Core

## ‚ùå The Mistake:

Manually managing `HttpClient` instances in ASP.NET Core can lead to DNS resolution issues.

## ‚úÖ The Fix:

Use `IHttpClientFactory`.

```csharp
services.AddHttpClient<MyService>();
```

Then inject it into your service:

```csharp
public class MyService
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public MyService(HttpClient httpClient)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
    }
}
```

## üö® 9. Not Handling Redirects Properly

## ‚ùå The Mistake:

Some APIs may **redirect** requests, but `HttpClient` follows redirects by default.

## ‚úÖ The Fix:

Disable redirects when necessary.

```csharp
var handler = new HttpClientHandler { AllowAutoRedirect = false };
var client = new HttpClient(handler);
```

## üö® 10. Not Using Compression (Wasting Bandwidth)

## ‚ùå The Mistake:

Fetching large responses without compression increases bandwidth usage.

## ‚úÖ The Fix:

Enable GZip compression.

```csharp
_httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.AcceptEncoding.Add(new StringWithQualityHeaderValue("gzip"));
```

## üéØ Conclusion

Using `HttpClient` efficiently can **boost performance, prevent memory leaks, and improve reliability** in your applications. By avoiding these **common mistakes**, you can write more robust and efficient HTTP clients in C#.NET.
