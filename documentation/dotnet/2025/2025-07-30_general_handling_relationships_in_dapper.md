**Dapper** is the most popular micro ORM in the .NET ecosystem, and it's a must to learn for any developer working with .NET.

If you're completely new to Dapper, we explored its basic methods in the previous blog post:

In this post, we'll focus on one of the most important aspects of working with any ORM, including Dapper, and that is handling relationships between entities.

## Relationships

**Relationships** define how data in one table is connected to data in another. They are essential for organizing data efficiently and avoiding redundancy.

For this blog post, weâ€™ll cover how to handle the three main types of relationships:

*   **One to one relationship**
*   **One to many relationship**
*   **Many to many relationship**

Without further ado, letâ€™s master relationships with Dapper.

## One to one relationships

True 1:1 relationships are typically used to extend existing models. Most real-world domains lean toward 1:N or N:N relationships instead.

In this example, a 1:1 relationship exists between User and UserPreferences. Each user has exactly one preference and each preference belongs to only one user.

```csharp
public class User
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    public string Name { get; set; }

    public UserPreferences Preferences { get; set; }

    public List<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }
}

public class UserPreferences
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    public bool DarkMode { get; set; }

    public int UserId { get; set; }

    public User User { get; set; }
}
```

Here is how to retrieve a user along with their preferences using Dapper:

```csharp
using var connection = factory.OpenConnection();

var sql = """
          SELECT u."Id", u."Name",
                  up."Id", up."DarkMode", up."UserId"
          FROM "Users" u
          JOIN "UserPreferences" up ON u."Id" = up."UserId"
          WHERE u."Id" = @UserId;
          """;

var users = await connection.QueryAsync(
    sql,
    (user, prefs) =>
    {
        user.Preferences = prefs;
        return user;
    },
    new { UserId = userId },
    splitOn: "Id"
);

return users.FirstOrDefault();
```

**QueryAsync<User, UserPreferences, User>** tells Dapper how to map the result into objects.

Thanks to the splitOn property, Dapper knows how to split the row between User and UserPreferences.

### SplitOn

The **splitOn** parameter indicates where the second object begins in the result set.

In our case, Dapper reads the result from left to right and starts filling the User object first. When it reaches the column named Id, it knows that this column belongs to the UserPreferences object, and starts mapping those properties accordingly.

When you have multiple objects to map in a single query result, the splitOn parameter should contain a comma separated list of column names, with one column per object.

## One to many relationships

A 1:N relationship is a type of data association where a single record in one table can be linked to multiple records in another table, while each record in the second table is linked to only one record in the first table.

For example, each owner can own multiple blogs, but each blog is associated with only one owner.

```csharp
public class User
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    public string Name { get; set; }

    public UserPreferences Preferences { get; set; }

    public List<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }
}

public class Blog
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    public string Name { get; set; }

    public string Description { get; set; }

    public int UserId { get; set; }

    public User User { get; set; }

    public List Tags { get; set; }
}
```

1:N relationships are a bit more complex, since it requires additional effort to map correctly.

```csharp
using var connection = factory.OpenConnection();

var sql = """
          SELECT u."Id", u."Name",
                 b."Id", b."Name", b."Description", b."UserId"
          FROM "Users" u
          LEFT JOIN "Blogs" b ON u."Id" = b."UserId"
          WHERE u."Id" = @UserId;
          """;

var userDict = new Dictionary<int, User>();

await connection.QueryAsync(
    sql,
    (user, blog) =>
    {
        if (!userDict.TryGetValue(user.Id, out var existingUser))
        {
            existingUser = user;
            existingUser.Blogs = new List<Blog>();
            userDict.Add(existingUser.Id, existingUser);
        }

        if (blog != null)
            existingUser.Blogs.Add(blog);

        return existingUser;
    },
    new { UserId = userId },
    splitOn: "Id"
);

return userDict[userId];
```

And here's the catch, when using a JOIN, the same user will appear for each related blog.

To avoid creating duplicate User instances, we need to use a dictionary. If not, we add the user and append the blog to that user's list. This process repeats for each row in the result set.

It might not be the cleanest approach, but itâ€™s effective and gets the job done.

## Many to many relationships

Just like with 1:N relationships, handling a N:M relationship also requires the use of a dictionary to avoid duplicate instances when mapping the results.

A N:M relationship means that a single record in Table A can be related to multiple records in Table B and vice versa.

For example, a single blog can have multiple tags, and each tag can be associated with multiple blogs.

```csharp
public class Blog
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    public string Name { get; set; }

    public string Description { get; set; }

    public int UserId { get; set; }

    public User User { get; set; }

    public List<Tag> Tags { get; set; }
}

public class Tag
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public List<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }
}
```

The implementation looks pretty similar:

```csharp
using var connection = factory.OpenConnection();

var sql = """
          SELECT b."Id", b."Name", b."Description", b."UserId",
                  t."Id", t."Name"
          FROM "Blogs" b
          LEFT JOIN "BlogTag" bt ON b."Id" = bt."BlogId"
          LEFT JOIN "Tags" t ON bt."TagId" = t."Id"
          WHERE b."UserId" = @UserId;
          """;

var blogDict = new Dictionary<int, Blog>();

await connection.QueryAsync<Blog, Tag, Blog>(
    sql,
    (blog, tag) =>
    {
        if (!blogDict.TryGetValue(blog.Id, out var existingBlog))
        {
            existingBlog = blog;
            existingBlog.Tags = [];
            blogDict.Add(existingBlog.Id, existingBlog);
        }

        if (tag != null)
        {
            existingBlog.Tags.Add(tag);
        }

        return existingBlog;
    },
    new { UserId = userId },
    splitOn: "Id"
);

return blogDict.Values;
```

## Conclusion

In this post, we explored how to manage the three main types of relationships using Dapper.

By understanding how to map these relationships properly with Dapperâ€™s QueryAsync method and using the splitOn parameter, you can efficiently retrieve and organize related data with minimal overhead.

With these techniques, you are well on your way to mastering relationships in Dapper.
