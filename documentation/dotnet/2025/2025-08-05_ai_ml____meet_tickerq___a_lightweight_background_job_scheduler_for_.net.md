# üöÄ Meet TickerQ ‚Äì A Lightweight Background Job Scheduler for .NET

### A simple, dependency-free alternative to Hangfire and Quartz with Cron support

When building .NET applications that require background jobs‚Äîlike sending daily reports, cleaning up logs, or syncing external services‚Äîdevelopers often reach for **Hangfire** or **Quartz.NET**. While these tools are powerful, they can be overkill for smaller apps or services that just need scheduled task execution with minimal overhead.

Introducing **TickerQ** ‚Äì a lightweight, in-memory job scheduler for .NET with built-in Cron expression support and async/await compatibility.

**TickerQ** is a high-performance background task scheduler for .NET that eliminates the need for reflection by using source generators. It supports both cron-based and time-based executions, integrates seamlessly with Entity Framework Core for persisting jobs and their states, and includes a real-time dashboard UI with minimal overhead.

### üîë Key Highlights:

*   Reflection-free job discovery using **source generators**
*   Supports **TimeTickers** (one-time tasks) and **CronTickers** (recurring tasks)
*   Built-in **EF Core** integration for job persistence, status tracking, and history
*   **Real-time dashboard** powered by SignalR, Tailwind CSS, and Vue.js
*   Advanced features like **retry policies**, **throttling**, and **cooldowns**
*   **Distributed job coordination**, **priority handling**, and **full DI support**

## üöÄ Why I Built TickerQ

I‚Äôve always appreciated clean code, minimal abstractions, and tools that just work ‚Äî especially in fast-paced development environments. But when it came to scheduling background tasks in .NET, I kept running into the same pain points:

*   Job schedulers that rely heavily on runtime reflection
*   Long startup times, especially in Docker environments
*   Over-engineered APIs that hide logic behind too much "magic"
*   Poor support for async flows and EF Core integration
*   Complex licensing models or steep learning curves just to scale

So I set out to build something better ‚Äî **TickerQ**. What began as a weekend experiment has now evolved into a powerful job scheduling framework that focuses on performance, clarity, and developer experience.

## üÜï What‚Äôs New in TickerQ 2.0.0?

### ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Source Generators = Zero Reflection

Reflection might be powerful, but it's also slow and hard to debug. With **TickerQ 2.0**, we've eliminated all runtime reflection. Instead, we use **source generators** to handle job discovery and wiring at compile time.

**Why this matters:**

*   Significantly faster cold start times
*   More predictable behavior (especially in production)
*   Richer IntelliSense and compile-time error checking
*   Cleaner, more traceable stack traces

Your jobs are now fully wired at build time ‚Äî no surprises at runtime.

### üìà 2. Live Dashboard (Finally!)

One of the most requested features is here: a built-in **real-time dashboard**.

Now you can monitor everything your background tasks are doing ‚Äî live. See job statuses like `Pending`, `Running`, or `Completed`, along with performance metrics and thread activity ‚Äî all from your browser.

**Built with:**

*   **SignalR** for real-time updates
*   **Vue.js + Tailwind CSS** for a clean UI
*   Easy to plug into your service

It‚Äôs like a lightweight Task Manager for your TickerQ jobs ‚Äî ideal for debugging and demos.

### üî• 3. Fully Static Runtime (No Dynamic Calls)

With 2.0, TickerQ‚Äôs runtime is now **100% static** ‚Äî meaning no dynamic method invocation or runtime type scanning.

**Benefits:**

*   Less memory allocation
*   Predictable performance in containers and cloud runtimes
*   Fewer edge-case bugs caused by reflection or dynamic logic
*   Easier to maintain and debug

If you care about speed, stability, or cloud deployment costs ‚Äî this change alone makes upgrading worth it.

### **üöÄ Installing & Configuring**

Use the following NuGet packages. While only the core `TickerQ` package is required, in this example we will also set up optional packages for EF Core persistence and the real-time dashboard:

```
dotnet add package TickerQ
dotnet add package TickerQ.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add package TickerQ.Dashboard
dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
```

### **In** `Program.cs`

```csharp
builder.Services.AddTickerQ(options =>
{
    options.SetMaxConcurrency(4);
    options.SetExceptionHandler<MyExceptionHandler>();
    options.AddOperationalStore<MyDbContext>(efOpt =>
    {
        efOpt.UseModelCustomizerForMigrations(); // Design-time migrations only
        efOpt.CancelMissedTickersOnApplicationRestart();
    });
    options.AddDashboard(basePath: "/tickerq-dashboard");
    options.AddDashboardBasicAuth();
});

app.UseTickerQ();
```

## **üéØ Defining and Scheduling Jobs**

TickerQ uses a `[TickerFunction]` attribute and compile‚Äëtime source generation. You can define multiple scheduled functions with different triggers:

```csharp
[TickerFunction("CleanupLogs")]
public static async Task CleanupLogs(TickerRequest req, CancellationToken ct)
{
    // Do cleanup work...
}

[TickerFunction("CleanupTempFiles","0 */6 * * *")]
public static Task CleanupTempFiles(TickerRequest req, CancellationToken ct)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Cleaning temporary files...");
    return Task.CompletedTask;
}
```

### **‚ñ∂Ô∏è TimeTicker example (fire-and-forget)**

```csharp
await _timeTickerManager.AddAsync(new TimeTicker
 {
     Function = "SendWelcome",
     ExecutionTime = DateTime.UtcNow,
     Request = TickerHelper.CreateTickerRequest<string>("User123"),
     Retries = 3,
     RetryIntervals = new[] { 30, 60, 120 }, // Retry after 30s, 60s, then 2min

 });
```

### **‚ñ∂Ô∏è TimeTicker example (one‚Äëoff or delayed)**

```csharp
await _timeTickerManager.AddAsync(new TimeTicker
 {
     Function = "SendWelcome",
     ExecutionTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(30),
     Request = TickerHelper.CreateTickerRequest<string>("User123"),
     Retries = 3,
     RetryIntervals = new[] { 30, 60, 120 }, // Retry after 30s, 60s, then 2min

 });
```

### **üîÅ CronTicker example (recurring)**

```csharp
await _cronTickerManager.AddAsync(new CronTicker
 {
     Function = "CleanupLogs",
     Expression = "0 */6 * * *",
     Retries = 2,
     RetryIntervals = new[] { 60, 300 }
 });
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Persistence with EF Core

To enable job persistence in TickerQ, you‚Äôll need to set up the required database tables using **EF Core migrations**.

TickerQ‚Äôs EF Core integration handles the storage of tickers, job execution history, and job state‚Äîall seamlessly within your existing `DbContext`.

There are two ways to integrate:

### üîß Option 1: `UseModelCustomizerForMigrations()`

Ideal for keeping your runtime model clean, this method adds the TickerQ schema **only during design-time** (like when running `dotnet ef migrations add`). It won‚Äôt affect your `DbContext` at runtime, making it perfect for projects that prefer separation of concerns.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Option 2: Manual Configuration

If you need full control or want the TickerQ tables to be part of your runtime model, you can manually configure them in your `OnModelCreating` method. This gives you full visibility and customization over how TickerQ‚Äôs data is mapped and stored.

Both methods are supported‚Äîchoose the one that fits your project‚Äôs architecture and preferences.

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
{
    base.OnModelCreating(builder);
    builder.ApplyConfiguration(new TimeTickerConfigurations());
    builder.ApplyConfiguration(new CronTickerConfigurations());
    builder.ApplyConfiguration(new CronTickerOccurrenceConfigurations());
}
```

**Apply migrations:**

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddTickerQTables
dotnet ef database update
```

## **üåê Dashboard UI & Real‚ÄëTime Monitoring**

The TickerQ Dashboard is a modern Vue.js-based web UI powered by SignalR and Tailwind CSS. It provides live updates and comprehensive control over job scheduling and monitoring.

### **Setup**

```csharp
builder.Services.AddTickerQ(options =>
{
    options.AddOperationalStore<MyDbContext>(opt =>
    {
        opt.UseModelCustomizerForMigrations();
        opt.CancelMissedTickersOnApplicationRestart();
    });
    options.AddDashboard(basePath: "/tickerq");
    options.AddDashboardBasicAuth();
});


app.UseTickerQ();
```

Add credentials in `appsettings.json`:

```json
"TickerQBasicAuth": {
  "Username": "admin",
  "Password": "admin"
}
```

### **Features**

*   **System Overview**: throughput, active nodes, concurrency.
*   **Job Status Breakdown**: Done, DueDone, Failed, Pending.
*   **CronTickers View**: timeline, manual trigger, duplication, deletion.
*   **TimeTickers View**: execution history, live retry/cancel/edit/delete options.
*   **Add/Edit Job**: intuitive UI to define function, payload, retry policy.
