# Installing Docker on Arch Linux

This guide provides a step-by-step process for installing Docker on Arch Linux.

## Prerequisites

- A running Arch Linux system
- A user account with sudo privileges

## Step 1: Update Your System

First, update your system to ensure all existing packages are up to date and minimize compatibility issues:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```

## Step 2: Install Docker

Install Docker along with useful additional components from the official Arch repository:

```bash
sudo pacman -S docker docker-compose docker-buildx
```

This installs:
- **docker**: The Docker engine itself
- **docker-compose**: A tool to orchestrate multi-container deployments
- **docker-buildx**: A CLI tool that extends Docker's build capabilities

## Step 3: Start and Enable the Docker Service

Start the Docker service and enable it to run automatically at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now docker.service
```

Verify that the service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl is-active docker.service
```

## Step 4: Verify the Installation

Test if Docker is working properly by running the "hello-world" container:

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

If you see a welcome message, Docker is successfully installed and running!

## Step 5: Enable Non-root Users to Run Docker Commands

By default, only root and users with sudo privileges can execute Docker commands. To allow your user to run Docker commands without sudo:

1. Add your user to the "docker" group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```

2. Activate the changes to the group for the current session:

```bash
newgrp docker
```

3. For permanent changes, reboot your system.

After this, you should be able to run Docker commands without using sudo.

## Conclusion

You've now successfully installed Docker on Arch Linux and configured it for use. You can start containerizing applications and taking advantage of Docker's features for your projects.

For more advanced usage, refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) or explore Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications.
