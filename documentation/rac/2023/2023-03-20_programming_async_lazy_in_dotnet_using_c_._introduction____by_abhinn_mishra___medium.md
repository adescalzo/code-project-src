  This article introduces Async Lazy, a .NET feature that combines lazy initialization with asynchronous tasks to enhance application performance. It explains how Async Lazy defers object creation until it's first used, enabling concurrent and asynchronous initialization of objects. The post covers its syntax, benefits such as improved performance and resource optimization, and discusses potential disadvantages like overhead and debugging complexity. Practical C# code examples illustrate its usage for tasks like asynchronously loading files, retrieving data from web APIs, and initializing database contexts.

# Async Lazy in DotNet using c#

Introduction:

In modern software development, asynchronous programming has become essential to increase the performance of an application. It allows us to run code concurrently, which helps us to perform various tasks simultaneously. One of the new features added to the .NET framework is async lazy, which allows us to use lazy initialization for asynchronous tasks. In this blog post, we will explore async lazy in detail, including how to use it, its benefits and disadvantages, and code snippets.

What is Async Lazy?

Async Lazy is a type of lazy initialization that allows us to perform asynchronous tasks during the initialization of an object. Lazy initialization is a technique that defers the creation of an object until it is first used. Async Lazy is a combination of the Lazy and Task classes that allows us to initialize an object asynchronously.

The Async Lazy class is available in the System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions namespace and can be instantiated using the AsyncLazy<T> class. The AsyncLazy<T> class takes a delegate that returns a Task<T> object, which is used to initialize the object asynchronously.

Syntax:

public class AsyncLazy<T\> : Lazy<Task<T\>>  
{  
    public AsyncLazy(Func<Task<T>> taskFactory);  
}

AsyncLazy<int\> asyncLazy = new AsyncLazy<int\>(async () =>  
{  
    await Task.Delay(1000);  
    return 5;  
});  
  
int result = await asyncLazy.Value;

In the above example, we created an AsyncLazy<int> object that returns 5 after a delay of 1 second. The Value property is used to retrieve the value from the asyncLazy object. The code uses the await keyword to wait for the result of the asynchronous operation.

Benefits of Async Lazy:

1.  Performance Improvement: Async Lazy helps to improve the performance of an application by deferring the initialization of an object until it is required. This reduces the startup time of an application.
2.  Concurrent Initialization: Async Lazy allows us to perform asynchronous initialization of an object, which helps to run multiple tasks concurrently.
3.  Resource Optimization: Async Lazy helps to optimize system resources by deferring the creation of an object until it is required. This reduces the memory usage of an application.

Disadvantages of Async Lazy:

1.  Overhead: Async Lazy introduces some overhead compared to the synchronous initialization of an object.
2.  Debugging: Debugging asynchronous code can be more challenging than synchronous code.

Here are some more code examples that demonstrate the usage of Async Lazy:

Example 1: Using Async Lazy to load a file asynchronously

AsyncLazy<string\> fileContents = new AsyncLazy<string\>(async () =>  
{  
    using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader("file.txt"))  
    {  
        return await reader.ReadToEndAsync();  
    }  
});  
  
string contents = await fileContents.Value;

In the above example, we create an AsyncLazy object that reads the contents of a file asynchronously. The `Value` property is used to retrieve the file contents. This code ensures that the file is only read when the `Value` property is first accessed, and not when the AsyncLazy object is created.

Example 2: Using Async Lazy to retrieve data from a web API

AsyncLazy<List<User>> users = new AsyncLazy<List<User>>(async () =>  
{  
    using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())  
    {  
        HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync("https://api.example.com/users");  
        string responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();  
        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<User>>(responseBody);  
    }  
});  
  
List<User> userList = await users.Value;

In this example, we create an AsyncLazy object that retrieves a list of users from a web API asynchronously. The `Value` property is used to retrieve the list of users. This code ensures that the web API is only called when the `Value` property is first accessed.

Example 3: Using Async Lazy to initialize a database context asynchronously

AsyncLazy<MyDbContext> dbContext = new AsyncLazy<MyDbContext>(async () =>  
{  
    string connectionString = Configuration.GetConnectionString("MyDbContext");  
    return new MyDbContext(connectionString);  
});  
  
MyDbContext context = await dbContext.Value;

In this example, we create an AsyncLazy object that initializes a database context asynchronously. The `Value` property is used to retrieve the database context. This code ensures that the database context is only initialized when the `Value` property is first accessed.

Conclusion:

Async Lazy is a useful feature in the .NET framework that allows us to perform asynchronous initialization of objects. It helps to improve the performance of an application by deferring the initialization of an object until it is first used. These code examples demonstrate how Async Lazy can be used to read files, retrieve data from web APIs, and initialize database contexts asynchronously.
