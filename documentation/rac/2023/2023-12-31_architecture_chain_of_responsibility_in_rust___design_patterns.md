summary: |
  This article introduces the Chain of Responsibility behavioral design pattern, which enables a request to be passed sequentially through a chain of potential handlers until it is processed. It provides a detailed conceptual example implemented in Rust, demonstrating how to build a flexible chain using `Box` pointers and trait objects for dynamic dispatch. The example simulates a patient's flow through various hospital departments, each acting as a handler in the chain. The content includes comprehensive Rust code snippets for the patient, department trait, and individual department handlers, along with the client code to illustrate the pattern's application.

# **Chain of Responsibility** in Rust

**Chain of Responsibility** is behavioral design pattern that allows passing request along the chain of potential handlers until one of them handles request.

The pattern allows multiple objects to handle the request without coupling sender class to the concrete classes of the receivers. The chain can be composed dynamically at runtime with any handler that follows a standard handler interface.

## Conceptual Example

The example demonstrates processing a patient through a chain of departments. The chain of responsibility is constructed as follows:

Patient -> Reception -> Doctor -> Medical -> Cashier

The chain is constructed using `Box` pointers, which means dynamic dispatch in runtime. Why? It seems quite difficult to narrow down implementation to a strict compile-time typing using generics: in order to construct a type of a full chain Rust needs full knowledge of the ‚Äúnext of the next‚Äù link in the chain. Thus, it would look like this:

let mut reception \= Reception::<Doctor::<Medical::<Cashier\>>>::new(doctor); // üò±

Instead, `Box` allows chaining in any combination:

let mut reception \= Reception::new(doctor); // üëç

let mut reception \= Reception::new(cashier); // üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

#### [](#example-0--patient-rs)**patient.rs:** Request

    let doctor \= Doctor::new(medical);
    let mut reception \= Reception::new(doctor);

    let mut patient \= Patient {
        name: "John".into(),
        ..Patient::default()
    };

    // Reception handles a patient passing him to the next link in the chain.
    // Reception -> Doctor -> Medical -> Cashier.
    reception.execute(&mut patient);

    println!("\\nThe patient has been already handled:\\n");

    reception.execute(&mut patient);
}

### Output

Reception registering a patient John
Doctor checking a patient John
Medical giving medicine to a patient John
Cashier getting money from a patient John

The patient has been already handled:

Patient registration is already done
A doctor checkup is already already done
Medicine is already given to a patient
Payment done
