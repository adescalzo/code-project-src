[In my last blog post](/@mesutatasoy/writing-business-rules-using-net-core-and-design-patterns-78b351d94eae), I covered the handling of advanced business rules using the Specification pattern and chain of responsibility. I would now like to explore another pattern I most greatly appreciate: the Fluent Builder! The pattern builds upon the classic Builder pattern with a fluent interface of the construction of complex objects in a clear and readable manner.

This post largely walks you through some details about the Fluent Builder pattern, its relationship with the Builder pattern, practical examples on .NET Core, pros and cons, nested builders, and the power to implement conditional cases. Let’s get started!

# What is Fluent Builder Pattern?

The Fluent Builder Pattern is a design pattern that makes it appealing to create challenging objects in a readable way, building them one step at a time. The builder allows the chaining of methods that set different properties of the object, with each method returning the builder itself to ensure that the Builder is fluent.

**Relationship to the Builder Pattern**

The Builder Pattern is created to separate the complicated object creation from its representation. The most prominent attributes include:

*   **Builder Interface:** method definitions to create object parts.
*   **Director:** controls the building of objects.
*   **Product:** the object which is constructed and is quite complex.

The Fluent Builder Pattern introduces method chaining through a fluent interface-built pattern. In a fluent interface, each method basically returns the builder instance, or rather object, which gives a more conceptualized approach to creating an object.

## Core Concepts of Fluent Builder Pattern

*   **Chaining Methods:** Each method on the builder, in turn, returns the builder’s instance, permitting one to call the next method in the chain with seamlessness.
*   **Immutability:** Typically, the object being built is immutable. This means that once the object has been constructed, it will not be altered.
*   **Encapsulation:** The building logic is encapsulated in the builder, removing the building process from the object’s implementation itself.

After some definitions, let’s dive into practical examples for better understanding. If we didn’t use the pattern to create complex objects, the code would look like this:

![C# code snippet showing direct object initialization with nested properties, illustrating a less readable approach for complex object creation.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*hQ2P-auP-ICqOTNM5qA0sg.png)

So what’s wrong with it ?

*   **Readability**: The object creation process becomes difficult to follow, especially with nested properties.
*   **Risk of Incomplete Configurations**: Each property must be set manually, increasing the chance of missed settings.
*   **Maintainability**: Changing or adding configurations requires locating every property assignment, making adjustments prone to error.

But there are some benefits; for example, it’s a great choice for creating simple objects while also helping to avoid overengineering.

Then, what if we want to use the pattern, the code will look like this;

![C# code snippet demonstrating the usage of a Fluent Builder pattern for creating a complex Report object, showing method chaining for improved readability.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*QTy9UqL8WrtvuKxChWfOXw.png)

## Usage with Fluent Builder

The builder pattern makes the object creation process straightforward, especially when configuring multiple sections:

![C# code snippet showing the fluent interface of a ReportBuilder, where methods are chained to configure different aspects of a report object.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*RKzyiYamIzg4Gu4w5huA5Q.png)

With this builder, the construction steps are clear, readable, and flexible, encapsulating object creation logic in one place. also it provide us to;

*   **Modularity**: The pattern allows for adding or removing configurations without disturbing the main code.
*   **Readability**: Makes configuration steps clear and concise, especially in cases of complex objects.
*   **Maintainability**: Centralizes setup logic in the builder, making updates simpler and promoting DRY principles.

Wait wait wait! There can be some tradeoffs to use this pattern;

*   **Complexity in Setup**: With many parameters or nested builders, chaining can become complex, leading to verbose code.
*   **Added Boilerplate**: Implementing builders often requires additional classes, which can be tedious in smaller projects.
*   **Reduced Flexibility**: Fluent chaining can limit flexibility if configurations need to be conditionally applied, requiring workarounds or breaking the chain.

I guess that’s not enough example for better understanding, let’s make it complex much!

I would like to also explain that one of the powerful features of the Fluent Builder Pattern is its ability to handle conditional logic during the building process. This flexibility allows you to tailor object configurations based on specific conditions or user preferences.

![C# code snippet of a NotificationBuilder demonstrating conditional logic within the fluent building process, allowing specific properties to be set based on a condition.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*3OxTul0HD-V_nhQ74sdyYA.png)

What is important here is that this conditional logic for setting the notification details does not intrude into the main flow of object creation; hence, it keeps a clean readable builder interface.

What if we have nested objects ? We have some builders to create a complex report object.

![C# code snippet defining the `ReportBuilder` class, which includes methods for setting report properties and adding sections using a nested `SectionBuilder`.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*XHhql19mEG1VkjvCr1DFzw.png)

![C# code snippet defining the `SectionBuilder` class, which is used to construct individual sections of a report, demonstrating methods for setting section title, content, and footer.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*wwEAEV6afaWVeDgi4X7zvA.png)

![C# code snippet defining the `Report` and `ReportSection` classes, which are the product objects built by the `ReportBuilder` and `SectionBuilder` respectively.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*6AL1dCYi7aBoA5vUKzl9PA.png)

This structure allows for a modular approach to building complex objects while maintaining a clean and fluent API.

Actually, we see that the pattern is used in .NET Core across various frameworks and libraries, including:

**ASP.NET Core Middleware Configuration**:

**Dependency Injection (DI) Setup**:

**HttpClientFactory Configuration**:

# **Conclusion**

The Fluent Builder is one of the powerful tools in .NET Core for describing complex object creation in a simpler manner with enhanced readability and maintainability of the code. Accordingly, it assists developers by providing an intuitive API for which the intentions of the object creation can easily be grasped. Having practical usage in configuration of ASP.NET Core for middleware, dependency injection, and different design scenarios, the Fluent Builder Pattern is an essential modern software development design pattern.
