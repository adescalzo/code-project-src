You’ve optimized your code, tested every endpoint, and even ran a few load tests. Everything looks fine — until it hits production. Suddenly, your API starts slowing down under real-world traffic. You’re staring at your Application Insights dashboard wondering:
**“Why is my .NET Core API slow in production?”**

I’ve been there. As a senior engineer managing multiple high-throughput .NET Core APIs, I’ve debugged more than my fair share of backend bottlenecks. And here’s the truth:

**The worst performance killers in ASP.NET Core aren’t in your controller code — they’re lurking underneath it.**

In this post, I’ll walk you through five hidden performance traps that I’ve seen cripple production systems. More importantly, I’ll show you exactly how to find and fix them — before your users find them for you.

# What Causes Hidden Performance Issues in .NET Core APIs?

.NET Core APIs can become slow due to several underlying factors that are often missed during development and basic QA. These aren’t typical syntax or logic bugs — they’re deeper, systemic inefficiencies such as:

*   Improper async/await usage
*   Inefficient EF Core queries
*   Middleware misuse
*   Thread pool starvation
*   Excessive or slow logging

Let’s break these down and see how you can spot — and squash — them.

# 1\. Async/Await Overuse and Blocking Calls

# The Problem:

You’ve async-ed all your methods, but somehow your API still behaves synchronously under load. In my experience, developers often introduce sync-over-async issues by blocking calls with `.Result` or `.Wait()`—especially inside constructors or static initializers.

# Root Cause:

Blocking on async calls leads to **thread pool starvation**, which means your server is waiting for available threads rather than processing requests.

# How to Detect It:

*   Use **dotnet-trace** or **Visual Studio Concurrency Visualizer** to inspect thread blocking.
*   High CPU with low throughput is a red flag.
*   Look for sync calls in logs or code like:

```csharp
var data = GetUserAsync().Result; //Blocking call
```

# How to Fix It:

*   Always use `await` inside asynchronous code paths.
*   Avoid async calls in constructors. Use `IAsyncFactory` or initialization methods instead.
*   Refactor blocking calls like this:

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> GetUser()  
{  
    var user = await _userService.GetUserAsync();  
    return Ok(user);  
}
```

# 2\. Inefficient Entity Framework Core Queries

# The Problem:

Your query works locally with 5 records, but in production with 50,000+ rows, it’s painfully slow. That’s often due to **unoptimized EF Core LINQ queries**, lazy loading, or missing indexes.

# Root Cause:

EF Core translates LINQ into SQL. But subtle code changes can generate N+1 queries, bring in huge joins, or fail to use indexes — especially with `Include()` and navigation properties.

# How to Detect It:

*   Use **EF Core logging** (`EnableSensitiveDataLogging`) to inspect SQL queries.
*   Profile with **MiniProfiler**, **SQL Server Profiler**, or **EFCore.BulkExtensions**.
*   Look for

```csharp
var users = _context.Users.ToList(); 
```

# How to Fix It:

*   Use `.AsNoTracking()` for read-only queries.
*   Use **projections** instead of loading full entities:

```csharp
var users = await _context.Users  
    .AsNoTracking()  
    .Select(u => new { u.Id, u.Name })  
    .ToListAsync();
```

*   Analyze your indexes with **SQL Execution Plans**.

# 3\. Misconfigured Middleware Pipeline

# The Problem:

Your middleware order is silently hurting performance. I’ve seen APIs load authentication after routing, or add expensive logging to every request — even static files.

# Root Cause:

ASP.NET Core middleware runs in the order it’s added. A wrong sequence can increase request latency or even break functionality.

# How to Detect It:

*   Review `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` for middleware order.
*   Measure request duration using **Application Insights** or **MiniProfiler**.
*   Look for common misorders:

```csharp
app.UseEndpoints(); // ❌ Placed before authentication  
app.UseAuthentication();
```

# How to Fix It:

*   Correct order typically is:

```csharp
app.UseRouting();  
app.UseAuthentication();  
app.UseAuthorization();  
app.UseEndpoints(...);
```

*   Add conditionals for environment-specific middleware like Swagger or CORS.
*   Avoid over-logging requests unless debugging.

# 4\. GC Pressure and Thread Starvation

# The Problem:

You experience high memory usage, slow response times, and CPU spikes — but nothing in your code seems wrong. The issue? You’re triggering frequent garbage collections due to object churn.

# Root Cause:

Large object allocations, unnecessary string manipulation, and frequent boxing can force the GC into overdrive, slowing everything down.

# How to Detect It:

*   Use **dotnet-counters**, **PerfView**, or **dotMemory** to monitor GC metrics.
*   Look for High Gen 2 collections
*   Look for High allocations per request
*   Look for Increasing memory without release

# How to Fix It:

*   Use `StringBuilder` instead of concatenation in loops.
*   Pool objects (e.g., `ArrayPool`, `MemoryPool`) for high-frequency operations.
*   Avoid large JSON payloads — use DTOs or paging.

```csharp
var sb = new StringBuilder();  
foreach (var item in items)  
{  
    sb.Append(item.ToString());  
}
```

# 5\. Excessive Exception Handling or Poor Logging

# The Problem:

You’re logging every warning, error, and stack trace — even when things are normal. Over time, this floods your storage and slows down your app.

# Root Cause:

Uncontrolled exception logging — especially in catch-all blocks — adds latency and can overwhelm log sinks like Seq, Elasticsearch, or even file systems.

# How to Detect It:

*   Look at your **Application Insights or Serilog** logs.
*   High volume of logs during normal traffic is a clear signal.
*   Code like this is problematic:

```csharp
catch (Exception ex)  
{  
    _logger.LogError(ex, "Something failed");  
    throw;  
}
```

# How to Fix It:

*   Log only meaningful exceptions.
*   Use filters or enrichers in Serilog to exclude known noise.
*   Use structured logging:

```csharp
_logger.LogError(ex, "Failed to process order {OrderId}", order.Id);
```

# FAQ: Common Developer Questions About .NET Core API Performance

# “How do I debug slow ASP.NET Core APIs in production?”

1.  Start with **Application Insights** for request duration and dependencies.
2.  Use **MiniProfiler** for database, view, and HTTP timings.
3.  Trace memory and CPU with **dotnet-trace** or **PerfView**.
4.  Check your logs for timeouts, exceptions, and anomalies.

# “What are the best tools to monitor .NET Core API performance?”

*   **MiniProfiler** (timing internal operations)
*   **dotnet-counters**, **dotnet-trace**
*   **Application Insights**, **New Relic**, **Datadog**
*   **EF Core logging** with query analysis
*   **Serilog with Seq or Grafana Loki**

# Conclusion: Spot the Trap Before It Bites You

The fastest APIs don’t just have great code — they avoid the hidden traps that silently degrade performance over time. Here’s a quick recap of what to watch for:

*   **Don’t block async code** — it’s a thread killer.
*   **Optimize EF Core queries** — lazy loading is not free.
*   **Middleware matters** — order is everything.
*   **Control memory usage** — GC isn’t magic.
*   **Log smarter, not louder** — too much logging = lagging.

**Run MiniProfiler on your API today — you might be surprised what you find.**

And if you’re serious about .NET Core performance, **don’t just log — trace, profile, and measure.**
