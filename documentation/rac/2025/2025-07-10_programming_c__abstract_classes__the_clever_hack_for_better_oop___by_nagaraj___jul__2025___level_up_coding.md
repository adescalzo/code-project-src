> Master C# abstract classes to expedite object-oriented programming. Start a step-by-step guide, including code, sample diagrams and advice on how this simplifies and benefits inheritance.

**Have you ever felt severely overwhelmed with badly written C# code, that you wondered how to reuse certain classes without duplicating some logic?**

Been there, done that, having to deal with redundant methods almost perpetually before I understood the very concept of abstract classes.

In this article, I will try to walk you through on how to use C# abstract classes to keep your OOP neat, tidy, and maintainable. This includes lots of code samples, diagrams, and pragmatic tips. The lessons I share are those I learned from my missteps and tragedies, and I hope to spare you all that mayhem in your own life. Let’s make smarter and simpler in doing OOP.

## 🏗️ Understand Abstract Classes in C#

The abstract class truly embodies a cornerstone concept of OOP and offers a template for related classes. Until the abstract classes came along and saved me, I was copying and pasting code.

_An abstract class represents a partially implemented class, which cannot be instantiated on its own. It defines common behavior (methods, properties) for its derived classes using the_ `_abstract_` _keyword._

They are useful when you want common logic but would leave some of the methods for the subclasses to implement. For instance, a base `Vehicle` class would house shared logic such as StartEngine, while in the subclass `Car`, more specific implementation is done. Abstract classes can contain both concrete and abstract members, but interfaces cannot.

## ⚙️ Set Up Your First Abstract Class

Abstraction is a way to improve code reusability. It became clear this way-after I was seen wrestling to duplicate logic across classes..

🔹**Abstract a class with shared functionality:**

![Code snippet for public abstract class Animal with Name, Age, Eat (concrete), and MakeSound (abstract) members.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1000/1*MrAXMcplZc1vW3LVFRWMDg.png)

_Make the class_ `_abstract_` _to prevent instantiation._

It has concrete methods (e.g., `Eat`) and abstract methods (e.g., `MakeSound`) that the subclasses must implement. Use this inside your console app or ASP.NET project to arrange related types, such as `Dog` or `Cat`, that share behavior.

> 🧩 Create abstract classes as reusable bases.

## 🧩 Define Abstract Methods for Flexibility

Abstract methods enforce specific behavior in their subclasses. Before abstract methods existed, I used to hardcode logic.

🔹**Declare a method that does not contain an implementation:**

![Code snippet for public abstract class Shape with CalculateArea abstract method.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*99NAGTZnypU8D-BxVQLqJA.png)

🔹**Subclasses must implement** `**CalculateArea**`**:**

![Code snippets for Circle and Rectangle classes inheriting from Shape and implementing CalculateArea.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1000/1*ASe22Dsdyq1Qnv-lRSl3DQ.png)

Abstract methods ensure that each subclass provides its own logic for the method while sharing the general structure provided by the base class. Use this for instances such as shapes, vehicles, or payment processors that differ in the behavior but share a common structure.

## 🏗️🔧 Implement Concrete Classes

Concrete classes breathe life into abstract classes by filling out those skeletal elements. I learned that hard way, after a long struggle with managing code reuse effectively.

🔹**Create a concrete class which inherits an abstract class:**

![Code snippet for public class Dog : Animal implementing MakeSound.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1000/1*qHDWFkLkMxNCK0fNNTtS_Q.png)

🔹**Use the concrete class:**

![Code snippet showing usage of Dog and Cat concrete classes, instantiating them and calling MakeSound and Eat.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:630/1*RhiWllWpqQJFESE6D7xTwg.png)

Concrete classes must implement all of the abstract members, and they also bear the option of implementing their special methods or properties. Think of a Dog that can implement a Fetch method while inheriting common behavior from Animal.

## 📐 Use Abstract Properties Effectively

Abstract properties preserve consistent data across subclasses. In the past, I would have scattered properties into code, but now abstract properties gave me the chance to clean my code.

🔹**Define an abstract property:**

```csharp
public abstract class Employee  
{  
    public string Name { get; set; }  
    public abstract decimal Salary { get; set; }  
      
    public void Work() => Console.WriteLine($"{Name} is working.");  
}
```

🔹**Implement in a subclass:**

```csharp
public class Developer : Employee  
{  
    private decimal _salary;  
      
    public override decimal Salary  
    {  
        get => _salary;  
        set => _salary = value >= 0 ? value : 0;  
    }  
}
```

Use it:

```csharp
Employee dev = new Developer { Name = "Mani", Salary = 100000 };  
dev.Work();  
Console.WriteLine($"Salary: {dev.Salary}");
```

## 🔌🏗️ Combine with Interfaces for Power

An abstract class and an interface design can be used to build a very robust architecture. I came to realize this after having my mustang class architecture with rigid hierarchies.

🔹**Define an interface and combine it with an abstract class:**

```csharp
public interface ILoggable  
{  
    void LogActivity();  
}  
  
public abstract class Vehicle  
{  
    public string Model { get; set; }  
    public abstract void Drive();  
}  
  
public class Car : Vehicle, ILoggable  
{  
    public override void Drive() => Console.WriteLine($"{Model} is driving.");  
    public void LogActivity() => Console.WriteLine($"Logged: {Model} driven at {DateTime.Now}");  
}
```

Use them:

```csharp
Car car = new Car { Model = "Sedan" };  
car.Drive();   
car.LogActivity();
```

Interface & Abstract / By Author

Interfaces bring in cross-cutting concerns (for example, logging), whereas abstract classes carry out the shared logic. This is the optimal approach in systems that need two or more behaviors, such as logging and auditing.

> 🔌🧩 Interfaces and abstract classes: two peas in a pod.

## ⚠️ Handle Common Pitfalls

Abstract classes have some quirks that are going to trip you up. I have been bitten by these quirks after a few frustrating bugs.

🚫 Common mistakes should be avoided:

🔹**Instantiation:** Abstract classes cannot be instantiable.

Cannot create an instance of the abstract type or interface ‘Vehicle’ / By Author

🔹**Missing Implementations:** All abstract members have to be implemented by subclasses.

```csharp
public class Cat : Animal // Gives an error if MakeSound is not implemented  
{  
    public Cat(string name, int age) { Name = name; Age = age; }  
    public override void MakeSound() => Console.WriteLine($"{Name} meows!");  
}
```

🔹**Overuse:** Use abstract classes to share logic, not just for sharing contracts (use interfaces for that).

🔹 **Sealing:** Instead of abstract classes consider sealed classes from which one can derive, avoiding inheritance. Judicially use null tests in inherited classes to deal with edge cases.

```csharp
if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(Name)) Name = "Unknown";
```

> Keep yourself updated in order to avoid common pitfalls and keep your OOP clean.

## ⚡Optimize Abstract Class Design

Some badly coded abstract classes could add code bloating. After detecting from performance and maintenance concerns, I redesigned mine.

🔹**Trim abstract classes:**

🔹**Minimize deep inheritance hierarchies with more than two levels, provided they only add more complexity:**

🔹**Wherever possible, use composition over inheritance:**
