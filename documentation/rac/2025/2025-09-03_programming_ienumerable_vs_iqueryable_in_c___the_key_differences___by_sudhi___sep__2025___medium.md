  [This article clarifies the fundamental differences between `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable` in C#, two interfaces commonly used for working with collections and queries. It highlights that `IEnumerable` executes queries in memory, fetching all data before filtering, which can be inefficient for database operations. In contrast, `IQueryable` builds an expression tree to push query logic down to the data source (like a database), ensuring only relevant data is retrieved. The article emphasizes the significant performance impact of choosing the correct interface, especially when interacting with databases, and provides clear guidelines on when to use each for optimal application efficiency.]

# IEnumerable vs IQueryable in C#: The Key Differences

_If you‚Äôve been coding in C# for a while, you‚Äôve probably bumped into_ **_IEnumerable_** _and_ **_IQueryable_**_._

_At first glance, they look kinda similar, both let you work with collections and queries. But under the hood, they behave very differently. And if you pick the wrong one, your app might end up pulling a truckload of unnecessary data from the database üööüì¶._

Let‚Äôs break this down in the simplest way possible.

üîë Quick Comparison

![Table providing a quick comparison of IEnumerable and IQueryable features.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*ZsNHRFNXxlC5cOUhmi2kfA.png)

## Where the Query Actually Runs

### IEnumerable: Runs in Memory

Think of `IEnumerable` as a ‚Äúpull everything, then filter locally‚Äù approach.

Operations (`Where`, `Select`, etc.) run in memory (client-side).

```csharp
IEnumerable<int> nums = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };  
var filtered = nums.Where(x => x > 3).ToList(); // Runs in memory
```

‚úÖ Great if your data is already in memory.  
‚ùå Terrible if it‚Äôs coming from a database, because it first pulls _all rows_ into memory, then applies filters. If you query a database, it pulls ALL data first, then filters in-memory (inefficient).

### IQueryable: Runs in Database

`IQueryable` builds an **expression tree** and pushes the filter down to the database (or any remote provider) / Builds an expression tree and executes the query remotely (e.g., SQL Server).

```csharp
IQueryable<int> nums = dbContext.Numbers.AsQueryable();  
var filtered = nums.Where(x => x > 3).ToList();   
// Translates to SQL: SELECT * FROM Numbers WHERE Value > 3
```

‚úÖ Only the relevant data is fetched.  
‚úÖ Database does the heavy lifting.  
‚ùå Limited to operations that the database understands (no fancy custom methods).

## Performance Impact

This is where the real difference shows.

‚ùå Inefficient with IEnumerable

```csharp
var badQuery = dbContext.Customers.AsEnumerable()  
                   .Where(c => c.Age > 30) // Runs in memory  
                   .ToList();
```

What happens here?  
üëâ All customers are fetched from the DB, then filtered in memory.  
That‚Äôs like downloading the entire Netflix library üé• just to watch one movie.

‚úÖEfficient with IQueryable

```csharp
var goodQuery = dbContext.Customers  
                   .Where(c => c.Age > 30)   
                   .ToList();
```

This becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Age > 30
```

üëâ Only the required data is sent across. Much faster, much cleaner.

## Supported Operations

*   **IEnumerable**: Works with all LINQ methods, because everything is local. You can even use your own custom methods.
*   **IQueryable**: Only supports what can be converted to SQL (or another provider‚Äôs language).

Example:

```csharp
// Works with IEnumerable  
var result = customers.Where(c => SomeComplexMethod(c)).ToList();  
  
// FAILS with IQueryable (can‚Äôt translate SomeComplexMethod into SQL)  
var result = dbContext.Customers  
                      .Where(c => SomeComplexMethod(c))  
                      .ToList();
```

### ‚úÖ When to Use What?

*   Use **IEnumerable** when:
    *   Data is already in memory (List<T>, Array, etc.)
    *   You need to use complex methods in your LINQ queries.
*   Use **IQueryable** when:
    *   You‚Äôre talking to a database (EF, Dapper, OData, etc.)
    *   You want the DB to optimize filtering, sorting, paging, etc.

### üìù Quick Summary

*   Same results? Yes (in small cases).
*   Different execution? Absolutely.
*   Performance? IQueryable wins hands down for DB queries.

> üëâ Rule of thumb:  
> If you‚Äôre hitting a **database**, use `IQueryable`.  
> If you‚Äôre working with **in-memory collections**, use `IEnumerable`.
