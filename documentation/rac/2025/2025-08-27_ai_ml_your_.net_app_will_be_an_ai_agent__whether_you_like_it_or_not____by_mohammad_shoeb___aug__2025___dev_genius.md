# Your .NET App Will Be an AI Agent (Whether You Like It or Not) | by Mohammad Shoeb | Aug, 2025 | Dev Genius

# Your .NET App Will Be an AI Agent (Whether You Like It or Not)

## Why This Blog Matters

At **Microsoft Build 2024**, Satya Nadella put it plainly:

> ‚ÄúEvery app will embrace AI agent capabilities‚Äù_üé•_ [_Build 2024 Keynote_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OviTSFqucI&ab_channel=Microsoft)

This isn‚Äôt marketing fluff. Microsoft is restructuring the .NET ecosystem around:

*   [**Semantic Kernel (SK)**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/) ‚Üí wrap your .NET logic as agentic plugins.
*   [**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/agent-extend-action-mcp) ‚Üí standard for discovery + invocation.
*   [**Azure Orchestration**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-orchestrations?tabs=csharp-inproc) ‚Üí Functions, Event Grid, Service Bus, AI Studio for scale + governance.

Whether you like it or not, your .NET APIs will be called by **agents reasoning about goals ‚Äî not just humans clicking buttons.**

## From APIs to Agents: The Evolution

üëâ **APIs wait. Agents act.**

## Enterprise in Practice: Order Management with Agents

Imagine an order management system at Contoso Electronics. In the old REST world, users called endpoints directly. In the new agentic paradigm, a finance agent chains together calls autonomously, handles retries, and notifies the user only when all is done ‚Äî while Azure governance keeps a watchful eye.

## Microsoft‚Äôs Agentic Stack

## 1\. Semantic Kernel (SK) ‚Äî AI Runtime for .NET

SK lets you expose .NET functions as AI-callable plugins. Planners then chain them together dynamically.

üìñ [Semantic Kernel Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/)

```csharp
// Order Plugin (production-flavored)  
public class OrderPlugin  
{  
    private readonly OrderService _service;  
    private readonly FinanceService _finance;  
    private readonly ILogger<OrderPlugin> _logger;  
  
    public OrderPlugin(OrderService service, FinanceService finance, ILogger<OrderPlugin> logger)  
    {  
        _service = service;  
        _finance = finance;  
        _logger = logger;  
    }  
  
    [KernelFunction("CreateOrder")]  
    public string CreateOrder(string product, int quantity, SKContext context)  
    {  
        _logger.LogInformation("Creating order for {Product}, Qty {Qty}", product, quantity);  
        var orderId = _service.Create(product, quantity);  
        context.Variables["orderId"] = orderId; // memory injection  
        return orderId;  
    }  
  
    [KernelFunction("NotifyFinance")]  
    public void NotifyFinance(SKContext context)  
    {  
        var orderId = context.Variables["orderId"];  
        _logger.LogInformation("Notifying Finance for Order {OrderId}", orderId);  
        _finance.Notify(orderId);  
    }  
}
```

**Planners** use these plugins dynamically:

```csharp
// Planner usage  
var result = await kernel.InvokePromptAsync(  
    "Order 200 units of WidgetA and notify Finance"  
);
```

üí° Note how `SKContext` + logging makes this **production-grade**, not demo-ware.

I have written deep dive blog earlier on creating [AI Agentic using Semantic kernal](https://towardsdev.com/semantic-kernel-microsofts-gateway-to-agentic-ai-and-the-one-sdk-you-should-master-in-2025-ef3004e918e4) and creating [creating multi agent system.](https://medium.com/@mohsho10/part-2-how-to-build-a-full-multi-agent-ai-system-in-net-a1804c6e12f1)

## 2\. Model Context Protocol (MCP) ‚Äî Standard Wiring

MCP is **gRPC for agents**.

*   Your .NET service registers its plugins.
*   Copilot in VS Code, Teams, Dynamics auto-discovers them.
*   No custom glue ‚Äî Copilot calls your tools natively.

üìñ [Model Context Protocol](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/educatordeveloperblog/unleashing-the-power-of-model-context-protocol-mcp-a-game-changer-in-ai-integrat/4397564)

I have written a detailed blog on [MCP](https://medium.com/dev-genius/mcp-c-sdk-the-future-nobody-notices-yet-507d9d931370) earlier.

## 3\. Azure Orchestration ‚Äî From Demo to Production

Microsoft anchors agent workflows in resilient cloud primitives:

*   **Durable Functions** ‚Üí checkpointed, retry-safe orchestration.
*   **Event Grid + Service Bus** ‚Üí absorb surges, meter retries.
*   **Azure AI Search (RBAC-aware)** ‚Üí semantic memory, governed by enterprise roles.

üìñ [Durable Functions Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview?tabs=in-process%2Cnodejs-v3%2Cv1-model)

When your agent floods Finance at **3 AM** with retries, these primitives are your brakes.

Please refer my earlier blog on [Workflow Orchestration](https://medium.com/towardsdev/youre-not-just-a-net-developer-anymore-why-microsoft-wants-you-thinking-in-workflows-8f5f4d0796e2) and how to do it.

## Before vs After

## Old World (REST)

```mermaid
flowchart LR  
    U[User] --> API[REST API /api/orders]  
    API --> DB[(SQL Server)]  
    API --> Resp[JSON Response]
```

## New World (Agentic .NET)

```mermaid
flowchart LR  
    U[User: "Order 200 units & notify Finance"]  
    --> C[Copilot Host]  
    --> M[MCP]  
    --> SK[Semantic Kernel Planner]  
    --> P[OrderPlugin: CreateOrder + NotifyFinance]  
    --> F[Finance System]
```

In the new world, **you don‚Äôt script the glue. The agent reasons it.**

## üîí Security: Zero Trust for Agents

Treat agents like hostile clients. Microsoft‚Äôs model is **layered enforcement**:

```mermaid
flowchart TD  
    A[Agent Request]   
    --> B[Azure AD / Managed Identity]  
    --> C[SK FunctionFilter]  
    --> D[Azure AI Content Safety]  
    --> E[Authorized Execution]
```

*   **Authentication:** Secure MCP endpoints with Azure AD.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)  
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi(builder.Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"));
```

*   **Authorization:** Restrict planners via SK `FunctionFilter`.
*   **Content Safety:** Block unsafe/jailbreak inputs.
*   **Data Governance:** RBAC in Cognitive Search ‚Üí HR data stays out of Finance workflows.

üìñ [Zero Trust for Developers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/develop/overview)

## üí∏ Scale & Cost: The CFO‚Äôs Question

Microsoft knows enterprises will ask: _‚ÄúHow much will this cost at scale?‚Äù_

*   **Elasticity** ‚Üí SK plugins in Azure Functions scale on demand.
*   **Token Spend** ‚Üí In one Azure AI Studio case, **prompt caching cut token usage by ~28%** on retrieval workflows.
*   **Retry Storms** ‚Üí Durable Functions checkpoint agent failures; Service Bus meters retries safely.

üìñ [Azure AI Studio: Prompt Shields & Caching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-safety/concepts/jailbreak-detection)

Ignore this, and your CFO will kill your project before it leaves dev.

## A Richer Orchestration Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD  
    U[User: "Order 200 units & notify Finance"]  
    --> C[Copilot Host]  
    --> M[MCP discovers .NET Tools]  
    --> SK[Semantic Kernel Planner]  
    -->|Step 1| O[CreateOrder Plugin]  
    -->|Step 2| B{Success?}  
    -->|Yes| F[NotifyFinance Plugin]  
    -->|No| R[Retry via Durable Functions]  
    R --> O
```

This isn‚Äôt just request/response. It‚Äôs **reasoning + retry-safe orchestration at cloud scale.**

## Hands-On Quickstart

*   Fork this template: \[[Sample .NET Agentic Plugin (Semantic Kernel)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/ai/)\]
*   Azure AI Studio Playground: Register and test your agent before production.
*   [.NET SDK for A2A (Agent-to-Agent](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/building-ai-agents-a2a-dotnet-sdk/)): Make your agent discoverable and extensible in 15 lines.

## Devil‚Äôs Advocate: What Could Go Wrong?

*   Agent Sprawl: Too many autonomous workflows? Version service interfaces; enforce registration policy.
*   Cost Spikes: Token and compute sprawl. Use SK plugin scaling + Azure Functions + prompt caching (saves 28% on retrieval, per Azure AI Studio).
*   Shadow IT: Guard agent onboarding with security reviews, FunctionFilters, org policies.

## The Future: What‚Äôs Next?

*   Multi-agent swarms: Orchestrate cooperative agents securely across teams/orgs.
*   Marketplace: Agents searchable, discoverable, reusable ‚Äî like APIs once were.
*   Agent Governance: Expect regulation, auditing, and an ‚Äúagentic SDLC.‚Äù

## Action Plan for .NET Engineers

1.  Wrap one API as an SK plugin this quarter.
2.  Register it via MCP ‚Üí Copilot-ready.
3.  Enforce Zero Trust ‚Üí Azure AD + FunctionFilters.
4.  Trace everything with OpenTelemetry.
5.  Pilot in Azure AI Studio before your competitor does.

## The Bottom Line

I‚Äôve been in **2 AM war-rooms** debugging APIs that failed silently because we assumed only humans would call them. That assumption is dead.

In Microsoft‚Äôs world, **your .NET services will be invoked by agents 24/7**. Sometimes in ways you never coded.

üëâ If you don‚Äôt start wrapping APIs this quarter, don‚Äôt be surprised when Copilot **skips your system and calls your competitor‚Äôs instead.**

You can lead this shift ‚Äî or be left invisible in Microsoft‚Äôs ecosystem.

## Over to You

Which service will you wrap first? Will it be yours that shows up in Copilot ‚Äî or your competitor‚Äôs? The agent era is here. Are you ready?
