The number one mistake Python developers make when exploring new libraries is starting with the question, _‚ÄúHow can I use this shiny new tool?‚Äù_ That‚Äôs fun, but it‚Äôs not the fastest path to mastery.

Image created using SORA.

Instead, I prefer to start with: _‚ÄúWhat problem am I trying to solve?‚Äù_

For me, that problem was **speed**. I‚Äôve been building automation pipelines that chew through millions of rows of CSV data, and while `pandas` has been my go-to for years, my scripts started to crawl. I could almost hear my CPU sigh every time I ran a join.

So, I decided to put `Polars` to the test. Not just as a fun experiment, but as a real replacement for `pandas` in my automation workflows.

Here‚Äôs what I learned ‚Äî and exactly how I replaced `pandas` with `Polars` without rewriting my entire codebase.

# Why Polars Even Exists

`Polars` is not just ‚Äúpandas but faster.‚Äù It‚Äôs a completely different beast under the hood.

*   **Language core:** Built in Rust ‚Äî meaning memory safety and blazing performance without the GIL drama.
*   **Execution engine:** Uses Apache Arrow and lazy evaluation to avoid unnecessary computations.
*   **Parallelization:** Utilizes multiple cores by default (unlike pandas, which often runs in a single thread).

Think of it as pandas after hitting the gym, cutting carbs, and drinking a double espresso.

Pro tip: _If your dataset is under 1M rows, pandas is fine. Over that, Polars starts flexing its muscles._

# Step 1 ‚Äî Installing and Setting Up Polars

Replacing `pandas` doesn‚Äôt have to be a full-blown migration. For me, it started with testing both libraries side-by-side.

```python
# Install Polars  
pip install polars  

# Import  
import polars as pl
```

If you‚Äôre used to `pd.read_csv()`, `Polars` won‚Äôt scare you:

```python
import polars as pl  

df = pl.read_csv("large_dataset.csv")  
print(df.head())
```

Notice the subtle difference: `pl.read_csv()` loads **fast** ‚Äî even on large files ‚Äî because Polars is columnar and streams the data efficiently.

# Step 2 ‚Äî Automating Data Cleaning (Where I Saw the First Big Win)

I had a data-cleaning script in pandas that took **22 seconds** to process ~4M rows. Polars did it in **2.8 seconds** without touching my CPU fan.

Pandas version:

```python
import pandas as pd  

df = pd.read_csv("large_dataset.csv")  
df = df.dropna()  
df["value"] = df["value"].astype(float)
```

Polars version:

```python
df = pl.read_csv("large_dataset.csv")  
df = df.drop_nulls()  
df = df.with_columns(pl.col("value").cast(pl.Float64))
```

Both scripts do the same thing ‚Äî but Polars does it lazily, meaning operations are planned and optimized before execution.

# Step 3 ‚Äî Speeding Up GroupBys and Joins

Automation pipelines often live or die on joins and aggregations. In pandas, these can be painfully slow.

Example:

```python
# Pandas  
merged = df1.merge(df2, on="id").groupby("category")["value"].mean()
```

In Polars, not only is it faster, but you can also chain without breaking your flow:

```python
result = (  
    df1.join(df2, on="id")  
       .group_by("category")  
       .agg(pl.col("value").mean())  
)
```

This reads cleaner and runs in parallel without me doing anything special.

# Step 4 ‚Äî Lazy vs. Eager Execution

This is where Polars‚Äô **automation advantage** shines.

With lazy execution (`scan_csv` instead of `read_csv`), Polars won‚Äôt load or process data until absolutely necessary. That means:

*   Less RAM usage
*   Fewer intermediate computations
*   Automatic query optimization

```python
df = pl.scan_csv("large_dataset.csv")  # Lazy  
df = df.filter(pl.col("value") > 100).select(["id", "value"])  
print(df.collect())  # Triggers execution
```

In my automation scripts, this was a game-changer ‚Äî especially when chaining multiple filters and transformations.

# Step 5 ‚Äî The ‚ÄúBut Pandas Has More Features‚Äù Argument

True. Pandas has been around longer, with more built-in tools. But here‚Äôs the thing:

*   For **ETL automation**, Polars already covers 95% of what you‚Äôll need.
*   Anything missing? Convert between formats easily:

```python
import pandas as pd  

pandas_df = df.to_pandas()
```

You can dip back into pandas for niche tasks without giving up Polars‚Äô speed.

# Step 6 ‚Äî Automating the Migration Process

Here‚Äôs the part most devs skip ‚Äî **automating the switch**.

If you‚Äôre replacing pandas in multiple scripts, don‚Äôt manually rewrite every import. Instead, wrap Polars in a compatibility layer for your most-used pandas patterns:

```python
# polars_wrapper.py  
import polars as pl  

def read_csv(path):  
    return pl.read_csv(path)  
def drop_nulls(df):  
    return df.drop_nulls()
```

Then, in your old scripts:

```python
from polars_wrapper import read_csv, drop_nulls
```

This allowed me to migrate **12 automation scripts in one afternoon** without breaking anything.

# Step 7 ‚Äî When You Shouldn‚Äôt Switch

Polars is not a silver bullet. You might want to stick with pandas if:

*   You‚Äôre using niche pandas-only functionality (certain time series features).
*   Your data is small and processing time is negligible.
*   You rely heavily on pandas‚Äô integration with other legacy libraries.

Otherwise? Polars is a no-brainer for performance.

# My Final Verdict

Switching to Polars for my automation workflows felt like upgrading from a bicycle to a sports car. It‚Äôs not about rewriting everything ‚Äî it‚Äôs about knowing **where** Polars gives you the biggest gains.

If you‚Äôre processing big CSVs, doing heavy joins, or chaining multiple transformations, Polars will save you hours over the course of a month.

Or as one of my favorite pro tips goes:

> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt optimize code ‚Äî optimize the time you spend waiting for it to run.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs exactly what Polars did for me.
