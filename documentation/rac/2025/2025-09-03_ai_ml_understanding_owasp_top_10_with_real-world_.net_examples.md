# Understanding OWASP Top 10 with Real-World .NET Examples

Application security is more critical than ever. According to industry reports, most data breaches are caused by exploitable software vulnerabilities. The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers that represents the most critical web application security risks.

In this article, we’ll explore the OWASP Top 10 (2021 edition) with real-world .NET examples that you can apply in ASP.NET Core MVC & Web API applications.

## 1. Broken Access Control

**Issue**: Users gain access to resources or actions they shouldn’t.

**Example (Bad)**

```csharp
// Anyone can access admin dashboard
public IActionResult AdminDashboard() => View();
```

**Solution**

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
public IActionResult AdminDashboard() => View();
```

## 2. Cryptographic Failures

**Issue:** Sensitive data (passwords, credit card numbers) is not properly encrypted.

**Example (Bad)**

```csharp
var password = "UserPassword123"; // stored in plain text
```

**Solution**

```csharp
var hashedPassword = _passwordHasher.HashPassword(user, password);
```

Always use ASP.NET Core Identity hashing or strong algorithms (PBKDF2, Argon2).

## 3. Injection

**Issue:** SQL injection through unvalidated input.

**Example (Bad)**

```csharp
var user = db.Users.FromSqlRaw($"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Email = '{email}'").FirstOrDefault();
```

**Solution**

```csharp
var user = await db.Users.FirstOrDefaultAsync(u => u.Email == email);
```

Always use parameterized queries or LINQ with EF Core.

## 4. Insecure Design

*   **Issue**: Application lacks security-by-design principles.
*   **Example**: Exposing APIs without rate limiting.

**Solution**

```csharp
// Add rate limiting in Program.cs
builder.Services.AddRateLimiter(options =>
{
    options.GlobalLimiter = PartitionedRateLimiter.Create<HttpContext, string>(
        _ => RateLimitPartition.GetFixedWindowLimiter("global", _ => new FixedWindowRateLimiterOptions
        {
            PermitLimit = 100,
            Window = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)
        }));
});
```

## 5. Security Misconfiguration

*   **Issue:** Default settings expose sensitive info.
*   **Example (Bad):** Showing stack traces in production.

**Solution**

```csharp
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}
```

## 6. Vulnerable & Outdated Components

**Issue:** Using outdated NuGet packages with known vulnerabilities.

**Solution**

```shell
dotnet list package --vulnerable
```

Keep dependencies updated and patch regularly.

## 7. Identification & Authentication Failures

**Issue:** Weak authentication mechanisms.

**Example (Bad)**

```csharp
if (username == "admin" && password == "1234") { ... }
```

**Solution**

*   Use ASP.NET Core Identity or OAuth2/OpenID Connect.
*   Enforce MFA and password policies.

## 8. Software & Data Integrity Failures

**Issue:** Applications rely on insecure updates or untrusted data.

**Solution**

*   Validate all external data sources (files, APIs).
*   Enable package integrity checks in NuGet.
*   Implement code signing for updates.

## 9. Security Logging & Monitoring Failures

**Issue:** Attacks go undetected due to inadequate logging.

**Solution**

```csharp
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
.WriteTo.File("logs/security.log")
.CreateLogger();
```

Log authentication attempts, errors, and unusual activity, and integrate with Azure Monitor/SIEM.

## 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Issue**: Application fetches remote resources without validation.

**Example (Bad)**

```csharp
var response = await httpClient.GetStringAsync(userProvidedUrl);
```

**Solution**

*   Whitelist trusted domains.
*   Validate and sanitize input URLs before making requests.

### Key Takeaways

*   The OWASP Top 10 provides a foundation for secure coding.
*   In ASP.NET Core, most risks can be mitigated with built-in features (Identity, Data Protection, Middleware).
*   Security must be a continuous practice, not a one-time fix.

### Final Thoughts

By applying the OWASP Top 10 guidelines in your .NET applications, you reduce risks of breaches, protect sensitive data, and build trust with users.
