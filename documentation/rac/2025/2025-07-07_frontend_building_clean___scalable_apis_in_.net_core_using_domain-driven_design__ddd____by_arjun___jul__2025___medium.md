summary: |
  This article introduces Domain-Driven Design (DDD) as a powerful approach for building clean, scalable, and testable APIs in .NET Core. It outlines a layered architectural structure, dividing the application into Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API layers, each with distinct responsibilities. The author provides practical C# code examples to illustrate the implementation of entities, use cases, data access with Entity Framework Core, and API controllers within this DDD framework. The post highlights the significant benefits of adopting DDD, including enhanced maintainability, improved testability of business logic, and better team alignment with core domain concepts.

## 🚀 Introduction

As software systems scale and evolve, structuring code around real business needs — not just technical layers — becomes essential. This is where **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** shines.

In this post, I’ll show how to implement a **clean, scalable, and testable API** using **.NET Core**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **DDD architecture**. Whether you’re working on enterprise systems or personal projects, adopting DDD principles can significantly improve maintainability and clarity.

## 🧠 Why Domain-Driven Design?

DDD is an approach that focuses on modeling software to match the **domain logic** — the core business rules. It allows you to:

*   Keep business logic separate from infrastructure code
*   Build systems that are easier to test and maintain
*   Speak a shared language across teams (developers + stakeholders)

## 🗂️ Recommended Folder Structure

```
📂 MyApp
 ┣ 📂 Domain           // Core models, business rules
 ┣ 📂 Application      // Use cases, interfaces, DTOs
 ┣ 📂 Infrastructure   // Data access, third-party services
 ┣ 📂 API              // Controllers, presentation layer
```

## 🧱 Domain Layer

The **Domain Layer** contains the real heart of your application: entities, value objects, and core logic. No EF Core. No APIs. Just pure business rules

```csharp
public class Order
{
    public Guid Id { get; private set; } = Guid.NewGuid();
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; private set; } = DateTime.UtcNow;
    public decimal TotalAmount { get; private set; }
    private List<OrderItem> _items = new();
    public IReadOnlyCollection<OrderItem> Items => _items.AsReadOnly();
    public void AddItem(OrderItem item)
    {
        if (item == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(item));
        _items.Add(item);
        TotalAmount += item.Price;
    }
}
```

## 📤 Application Layer

This is where we define **use cases and services** that use the domain logic.

```csharp
public class CreateOrderCommand
{
    public List<OrderItemDto> Items { get; set; }
}

public class OrderService : IOrderService
{
    private readonly IOrderRepository _repository;
    public OrderService(IOrderRepository repository)
    {
        _repository = repository;
    }
    public async Task<Guid> CreateOrderAsync(CreateOrderCommand command)
    {
        var order = new Order();
        foreach (var item in command.Items)
        {
            order.AddItem(new OrderItem(item.ProductId, item.Price));
        }
        await _repository.AddAsync(order);
        return order.Id;
    }
}
```

## 🛠️ Infrastructure Layer

Handles actual **data access** using Entity Framework Core.

```csharp
public class OrderRepository : IOrderRepository
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _context;

    public OrderRepository(AppDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public async Task AddAsync(Order order)
    {
        _context.Orders.Add(order);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
}
```

## 🌐 API Layer

This is the outermost layer and **should not contain business logic**.

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class OrdersController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IOrderService _service;

    public OrdersController(IOrderService service)
    {
        _service = service;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Create([FromBody] CreateOrderCommand command)
    {
        var id = await _service.CreateOrderAsync(command);
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetById), new { id }, null);
    }
}
```

## 📈 Real-World Benefits I’ve Observed

From my experience applying this in production systems:

*   Code is easier to reason about and maintain
*   Business logic is portable and testable
*   Teams are more aligned around the domain
*   Adding new features becomes simpler and cleaner

## 🧪 Final Thoughts

If you’re building APIs in .NET Core, combining it with DDD gives you the best of both worlds: a clean structure **and** a powerful way to model real business problems.

Start small — separate your domain logic, use interfaces in your application layer, and abstract away your infrastructure. As your app grows, this structure will save you hours of tech debt and refactoring.
