### A Practical Guide to Implementing Structured Logging with Serilog in ASP.NET Core

[Kanaiya Katarmal](https://substack.com/@kanaiyakatarmal)

Jul 28, 2025

In modern software development, effective logging isn‚Äôt just a good-to-have feature‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity. Whether you're debugging tricky production bugs or monitoring performance bottlenecks, a well-integrated logging framework is your best ally.

In this article, we‚Äôll break down how logging works, introduce Serilog‚Äîone of the most powerful structured logging libraries in the .NET ecosystem‚Äîand walk through how to integrate it cleanly into an ASP.NET Core application.

## üîç What Is Logging?

Logging is the act of recording diagnostic and operational data generated by an application. These logs can be written to various targets like console output, log files, databases, or even centralized log management systems.

**Why is logging essential?**

*   **Debugging & Troubleshooting:** Logs help trace back what happened before a bug occurred or a system failure took place.
*   **Auditing & Compliance:** Keeping a record of user actions and system events can be essential for security audits.
*   **Performance Tracking:** Logs can reveal response times, load times, and other metrics critical for tuning application performance.

## üìä Log Levels in .NET

To manage the verbosity and importance of logs, we categorize them using log levels. Here are the standard ones in .NET Core:

*   `Trace` ‚Äì The most granular level, used for very low-level diagnostics.
*   `Debug` ‚Äì Useful for developers when debugging logic.
*   `Information` ‚Äì Tracks general application flow and successful operations.
*   `Warning` ‚Äì Flags potential issues that aren‚Äôt necessarily errors (yet).
*   `Error` ‚Äì Captures failures that prevent normal operations.
*   `Critical` ‚Äì For severe issues that cause complete application failure.
*   `None` ‚Äì Disables logging entirely.

Understanding log levels allows you to fine-tune what gets logged in development vs production environments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Integrating Serilog in ASP.NET Core

Serilog is a structured logging library that goes beyond plain text logs. It enables logs to be emitted in a machine-readable format like JSON, which is invaluable when working with log aggregators such as ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Seq.

### üîß Step 1: Install Required Packages

To get started, add the following NuGet packages:

```bash
dotnet add package Serilog.AspNetCore
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.Console
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.File
dotnet add package Serilog.Enrichers.Environment
```

These packages integrate Serilog with the ASP.NET Core pipeline and enable file-based logging.

---

### üõ† Step 2: Configure Serilog in Program.cs

Update your `Program.cs` file (or wherever your application bootstraps) to initialize Serilog:

```csharp
var logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .ReadFrom.Configuration(builder.Configuration)
    .Enrich.FromLogContext()
    .CreateLogger();

builder.Logging.ClearProviders(); // Optional: Remove default logging
builder.Logging.AddSerilog(logger);
```

This setup tells ASP.NET Core to use Serilog as its logging provider and read configurations (like file paths and log levels) from `appsettings.json`.

### üìù Step 3: Serilog configuration in the app settings file.

```json
{
    "Serilog": {
        "MinimumLevel": {
            "Default": "Information",
            "Override": {
                "Microsoft": "Warning",
                "System": "Warning"
            }
        },
        "WriteTo": [
            {
                "Name": "Console",
                "Args": {
                    "outputTemplate": "[{Timestamp:HH:mm:ss} {Level:u3}] {Message:lj}  {RequestId} {SourceContext} {EnvironmentName}{NewLine}{Exception}"
                }
            },
            {
                "Name": "File",
                "Args": {
                    "path": "logs/log-.txt",
                    "rollingInterval": "Day",
                    "outputTemplate": "[{Timestamp:HH:mm:ss} {Level:u3}] {Message:lj}  {RequestId} {SourceContext} {EnvironmentName}{NewLine}{Exception}"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### üìù Step 4: Use ILogger in Controllers or Services

Serilog works with the standard `ILogger<T>` abstraction, so you don‚Äôt need to use any special API in your code:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class SampleController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ILogger<SampleController> _logger;

    public SampleController(ILogger<SampleController> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult Get()
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("GET endpoint was called.");
        return Ok("Request succeeded.");
    }
}
```

With this approach, Serilog quietly handles all the heavy lifting behind the scenes.

### üßæ Sample Log Output

If you're using a plain text sink, the output might look like this:

```
[18:38:05 INF] GET endpoint was called.  0HNEC8LP75O19:00000007 SerilogDemo.Controllers.SampleController Development
```

## üöÄ Benefits of Using Serilog

Serilog isn‚Äôt just another logging library‚Äîit‚Äôs purpose-built for structured, modern logging. Here‚Äôs why it stands out:

### ‚úÖ Structured Logging

Instead of plain strings, you can log structured data like:

```csharp
_logger.LogInformation("User {UserId} placed an order for {Product}", userId, productName);
```

This allows your log analysis tools to query logs by fields (e.g., all logs for a specific `UserId`).

### üîç Logging HTTP Requests Automatically

One powerful feature of Serilog in ASP.NET Core is the ability to **automatically log HTTP request information**, such as:

*   HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
*   Request path and response status code
*   Execution time
*   Correlation ID (`RequestId`)

To enable this, simply add the following middleware in your application's pipeline:

```csharp
app.UseSerilogRequestLogging();
```

Place it typically **after** `UseRouting()` **and before** `UseEndpoints()` in your `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`:

```csharp
app.UseRouting();

app.UseSerilogRequestLogging(); // Logs incoming HTTP requests with status and duration
```

This middleware hooks into the request lifecycle and automatically emits structured logs for each incoming request. Here‚Äôs an example of the output:

```
[18:44:05 INF] HTTP GET /api/Sample responded 200 in 147.6759 ms  0HNEC8P4P5CGJ:00000007 Serilog.AspNetCore.RequestLoggingMiddleware Development
```

This single line gives you:

*   The HTTP method (`GET`)
*   The request path (`/api/sample`)
*   The status code (`200`)
*   How long the request took (`34 ms`)

### üé® Flexible Formatting

Serilog lets you control how logs are output whether it's compact JSON, simple text, or colored console logs. You can fine-tune the output to suit different environments.

### üîå Extensible Sinks

Serilog supports a vast ecosystem of **sinks**‚Äîplugins that send log data to various destinations like:

*   Files
*   Databases
*   Seq
*   Azure Application Insights
*   Elasticsearch

You can add multiple sinks at once depending on your need.

### üß† Context Enrichers

You can enrich logs with contextual data like request IDs, user info, or environment name automatically.

```csharp
.Enrich.FromLogContext()
.Enrich.WithMachineName()
.Enrich.WithEnvironmentName()
```

## ‚ö° Asynchronous Logging

Heavy logging can block the main thread. Serilog supports non-blocking, asynchronous logging to avoid performance hits.

### üîß Configuration Flexibility

Serilog configurations can be handled via code or external files (`appsettings.json`), enabling dynamic control over log levels, sinks, and more.

## üìö Wrapping Up

Logging is your window into the internal workings of your app. With Serilog, .NET developers get a robust, extensible, and developer-friendly logging solution out of the box.

Start with simple file logging and grow into more advanced use cases like centralized logging, log filtering, and custom enrichers.

üß≠ **Next Steps**:

*   Explore Serilog‚Äôs official documentation
*   Add console or cloud-based sinks
*   Integrate with ELK or Seq for better log visualization

---

‚úÖ **TL;DR**: Serilog offers structured, performant, and extensible logging for ASP.NET Core developers. It integrates seamlessly with the logging system and brings serious improvements in observability and diagnostics.
