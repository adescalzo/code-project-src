# Design Patterns Guide in .NET Using C# -Part I: Detailed explanation

![Design Patterns Guide in .NET Using C# title image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*SUUF9JZ-_q13F-dQ.png)

Design patterns represent proven solutions to **recurring software design problems, providing developers with a structured approach to building maintainable and scalable applications**. In .NET development, understanding and implementing design patterns leads to more robust, flexible, and testable code that can adapt to changing requirements over time. This comprehensive guide explores the most important design patterns in C# development, demonstrating their practical applications through real-world examples and implementation strategies.

### Why Design Patterns Matter in .NET Development

Design patterns serve as a common vocabulary among developers, enabling teams to communicate complex architectural concepts efficiently. They encapsulate best practices that have evolved over decades of software development, helping developers avoid common pitfalls and anti-patterns. In modern .NET applications, design patterns work seamlessly with frameworks like ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, and dependency injection containers.

The benefits of using design patterns include improved code reusability, enhanced maintainability, better testability, and reduced coupling between components. Modern .NET development heavily relies on patterns like Dependency Injection, which has become a fundamental part of the framework itself.

Design Pattern Usage in Enterprise .NET Applications

### Categories of Design Patterns

Design patterns are traditionally classified into three main categories, each addressing different aspects of software design.

**Creational Patterns:**
Creational patterns **focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexibility in how objects are instantiated and configured**. These patterns help manage object creation complexity and promote loose coupling between classes.

> **Available Creational Patterns:**
> - Singleton
> - Factory Method
> - Abstract Factory
> - Builder
> - Prototype
> - Object Pool
> - Dependency Injection

**Structural Patterns:**
Structural patterns deal with o**bject composition and relationships between entities**. They help organize classes and objects to form larger structures while maintaining flexibility and efficiency.

> **Available Structural Patterns:**
> - Adapter
> - Bridge
> - Composite
> - Decorator
> - Facade
> - Flyweight
> - Proxy

**Behavioral Patterns:**
Behavioral patterns focus on **communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities**. They help manage complex control flows and interactions between multiple objects.

> **Available Behavioral Patterns:**
> - Observer
> - Strategy
> - Command
> - State
> - Template Method
> - Chain of Responsibility
> - Mediator
> - Memento
> - Visitor
> - Iterator
> - Interpreter

### Pattern Explanations with Real-Time Sample Code

Now, let’s understand few important and mostly used design patterns in detail with sample implementations in C#.

### - Creational Patterns:

1.  **Singleton Pattern:**
    -   **Why do we need it?**
        The Singleton pattern **ensures that a class has only one instance throughout the application lifecycle, providing global access to that instance**. This is essential for resources like logging services, configuration managers, or database connections where multiple instances could cause conflicts or resource waste.
    -   **What is it?**
        Singleton restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object and provides a global access point to that instance. It combines instance control with global accessibility in a thread-safe manner.
    -   **When to use it?**
        Use Singleton when exactly one instance of a class is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as **logging, caching, or managing shared resources**. It’s particularly useful for expensive to create objects that should be reused.
    -   **How to implement it?**

    ```csharp
    public sealed class Logger
    {
        private static readonly Lazy<Logger> _instance = new Lazy<Logger>(() => new Logger());
        private static readonly object _lock = new object();

        private Logger() { }

        public static Logger Instance => _instance.Value;

        public void Log(string message, LogLevel level = LogLevel.Info)
        {
            lock (_lock)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"[{DateTime.Now:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss}] [{level}] {message}");
            }
        }
    }

    //Program.cs
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("=== Singleton Pattern Demo ===");

            // Get the singleton instance and use it
            var logger = Logger.Instance;
            logger.Log("Application started", LogLevel.Info);
            logger.Log("Processing user request", LogLevel.Info);
            logger.Log("Invalid input detected", LogLevel.Warning);
            logger.Log("Database connection failed", LogLevel.Error);

            // Verify it's the same instance
            var anotherLogger = Logger.Instance;
            Console.WriteLine($"Same instance? {ReferenceEquals(logger, anotherLogger)}");

            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
    ```

2.  **Factory Method Pattern:**
    -   **Why do we need it?**
        Factory Method **provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their exact classes, allowing subclasses to determine which class to instantiate**. This promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need for classes to know about specific implementation details.
    -   **What is it?**
        Factory Method defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It delegates object creation to subclasses while maintaining a consistent interface.
    -   **When to use it?**
        Use Factory Method when a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create, or when you want to delegate object creation to subclasses. It’s ideal for plugin architectures or when object creation involves complex logic.
    -   **How to implement it?**

    ```csharp
    public abstract class DocumentProcessor
    {
        public abstract IDocument CreateDocument();

        public void ProcessDocument(string content)
        {
            var document = CreateDocument();
            document.SetContent(content);
            document.Process();
            document.Save();
        }
    }

    public class PdfProcessor : DocumentProcessor
    {
        public override IDocument CreateDocument() => new PdfDocument();
    }

    public class WordProcessor : DocumentProcessor
    {
        public override IDocument CreateDocument() => new WordDocument();
    }

    public interface IDocument
    {
        void SetContent(string content);
        void Process();
        void Save();
    }

    public class PdfDocument : IDocument
    {
        private string _content;

        public void SetContent(string content) => _content = content;
        public void Process() => Console.WriteLine($"Processing PDF document: {_content}");
        public void Save() => Console.WriteLine("PDF document saved successfully");
    }

    public class WordDocument : IDocument
    {
        private string _content;

        public void SetContent(string content) => _content = content;
        public void Process() => Console.WriteLine($"Processing Word document: {_content}");
        public void Save() => Console.WriteLine("Word document saved successfully");
    }

    //Program.cs
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("=== Factory Method Pattern Demo ===");

            // Create different document processors
            DocumentProcessor pdfProcessor = new PdfProcessor();
            DocumentProcessor wordProcessor = new WordProcessor();

            // Process PDF document
            Console.WriteLine("Processing PDF:");
            pdfProcessor.ProcessDocument("This is PDF content");

            Console.WriteLine();

            // Process Word document
            Console.WriteLine("Processing Word:");
            wordProcessor.ProcessDocument("This is Word content");

            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
    ```

3.  **Abstract Factory Pattern:**
    -   **Why do we need it?**
        Abstract Factory provides **an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes**. This ensures that related objects are created together and maintain consistency within the object family.
    -   **What is it?**
        Abstract Factory creates families of related objects through a common interface, ensuring that all created objects work together harmoniously. It provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories.
    -   **When to use it?**
        Use Abstract Factory when your system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, or when you need to ensure that related objects are used together. It’s particularly useful for cross-platform applications or theme-based UI components.
    -   **How to implement it?**

    ```csharp
    public interface IUIFactory
    {
        IButton CreateButton();
        ITextBox CreateTextBox();
    }

    public class WindowsUIFactory : IUIFactory
    {
        public IButton CreateButton() => new WindowsButton();
        public ITextBox CreateTextBox() => new WindowsTextBox();
    }

    public class MacUIFactory : IUIFactory
    {
        public IButton CreateButton() => new MacButton();
        public ITextBox CreateTextBox() => new MacTextBox();
    }

    public interface IButton
    {
        void Render();
        void OnClick();
    }

    public interface ITextBox
    {
        void Render();
        void SetText(string text);
    }

    public class WindowsButton : IButton
    {
        public void Render() => Console.WriteLine("Rendering Windows-style button");
        public void OnClick() => Console.WriteLine("Windows button clicked with system sound");
    }

    public class WindowsTextBox : ITextBox
    {
        private string _text;
        public void Render() => Console.WriteLine("Rendering Windows-style textbox");
        public void SetText(string text) => _text = text;
    }

    public class MacButton : IButton
    {
        public void Render() => Console.WriteLine("Rendering Mac-style button with rounded corners");
        public void OnClick() => Console.WriteLine("Mac button clicked with smooth animation");
    }

    public class MacTextBox : ITextBox
    {
        private string _text;
        public void Render() => Console.WriteLine("Rendering Mac-style textbox with clean design");
        public void SetText(string text) => _text = text;
    }

    public class Application
    {
        private readonly IUIFactory _uiFactory;

        public Application(IUIFactory uiFactory)
        {
            _uiFactory = uiFactory;
        }

        public void CreateUI()
        {
            var button = _uiFactory.CreateButton();
            var textBox = _uiFactory.CreateTextBox();

            button.Render();
            textBox.Render();
            textBox.SetText("Hello World!");
            button.OnClick();
        }
    }

    //Program.cs
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("=== Abstract Factory Pattern Demo ===");

            // Create Windows application
            Console.WriteLine("Creating Windows Application:");
            var windowsFactory = new WindowsUIFactory();
            var windowsApp = new Application(windowsFactory);
            windowsApp.CreateUI();

            Console.WriteLine();

            // Create Mac application
            Console.WriteLine("Creating Mac Application:");
            var macFactory = new MacUIFactory();
            var macApp = new Application(macFactory);
            macApp.CreateUI();

            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
    ```

    Abstract Factory Design Pattern in C#

4.  **Builder Pattern:**
    -   **Why do we need it?**
        Builder pattern **separates the construction of complex objects from their representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations**. This is essential when creating objects with many optional parameters or complex initialization logic.
    -   **What is it?**
        Builder constructs complex objects step by step, providing fine control over the construction process. It allows you to create different representations of an object using the same construction code.
    -   **When to use it?**
        Use Builder when creating objects with many parameters, especially optional ones, or when the construction process is complex and should be separated from the object representation. It’s ideal for creating immutable objects or configuration objects.
    -   **How to implement it?**

    ```csharp
    public class DatabaseConnection
    {
        public string Server { get; set; }
        public string Database { get; set; }
        public string Username { get; set; }
        public string Password { get; set; }
        public int Timeout { get; set; }
        public bool UseSSL { get; set; }

        public void Connect()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Connecting to {Server}/{Database} as {Username}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Timeout: {Timeout}s, SSL: {UseSSL}");
            Console.WriteLine("Connection established successfully!");
        }
    }

    public class DatabaseConnectionBuilder
    {
        private readonly DatabaseConnection _connection = new DatabaseConnection();

        public DatabaseConnectionBuilder SetServer(string server)
        {
            _connection.Server = server;
            return this;
        }

        public DatabaseConnectionBuilder SetDatabase(string database)
        {
            _connection.Database = database;
            return this;
        }

        public DatabaseConnectionBuilder SetCredentials(string username, string password)
        {
            _connection.Username = username;
            _connection.Password = password;
            return this;
        }

        public DatabaseConnectionBuilder SetTimeout(int timeout)
        {
            _connection.Timeout = timeout;
            return this;
        }

        public DatabaseConnectionBuilder EnableSSL()
        {
            _connection.UseSSL = true;
            return this;
        }

        public DatabaseConnection Build() => _connection;
    }

    //Program.cs
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("=== Builder Pattern Demo ===");

            // Build production database connection
            Console.WriteLine("Building Production Database Connection:");
            var prodConnection = new DatabaseConnectionBuilder()
                .SetServer("prod-db-server.company.com")
                .SetDatabase("ProductionDB")
                .SetCredentials("prod_user", "secure_password")
                .SetTimeout(30)
                .EnableSSL()
                .Build();

            prodConnection.Connect();

            Console.WriteLine();

            // Build development database connection
            Console.WriteLine("Building Development Database Connection:");
            var devConnection = new DatabaseConnectionBuilder()
                .SetServer("localhost")
                .SetDatabase("DevDB")
                .SetCredentials("dev_user", "dev_password")
                .SetTimeout(15)
                .Build(); // No SSL for dev

            devConnection.Connect();

            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
    ```

    Builder Design Pattern in C# with Examples

5.  **Prototype Pattern:**
    -   **Why do we need it?**
        Prototype pattern **creates new objects by copying existing instances, which is useful when object creation is expensive or when you need to create objects similar to existing ones**. This avoids the overhead of creating objects from scratch.
    -   **What is it?**
        Prototype creates new objects by cloning existing instances rather than instantiating new ones. It provides a way to copy objects without coupling to their specific classes.
    -   **When to use it?**
        Use Prototype when object creation is costly, when you need to avoid subclassing, or **when you want to create objects at runtime whose classes are determined dynamically**. It’s particularly useful for objects with complex initialization.
    -   **How to implement it?**

    ```csharp
    public abstract class GameCharacter : ICloneable
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public int Health { get; set; }
        public int AttackPower { get; set; }

        public abstract object Clone();
        public abstract void DisplayInfo();
        public abstract void Attack();
    }

    public class Warrior : GameCharacter
    {
        public string WeaponType { get; set; }

        {
            return new Warrior
            {
                Name = this.Name,
                Health = this.Health,
                AttackPower = this.AttackPower,
                WeaponType = this.WeaponType
            };
        }

    Prototype Design Pattern in C# with Examples

### - Structural Patterns:

1.  **Adapter Pattern:**
    -   **Why do we need it?**
        Adapter pattern **allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting one interface into another that clients expect**. This is essential when integrating third-party libraries or legacy systems with different interfaces.
    -   **What is it?**
        Adapter acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, wrapping an existing class with a new interface. It translates calls from one interface to another without modifying the original implementation.
    -   **When to use it?**
        Use Adapter when you want to use an existing class with an incompatible interface, or when you need to integrate systems with different interfaces. It’s commonly used for third-party library integration.
    -   **How to implement it?**

    ```csharp
    // Third-party payment service (cannot modify)
    public class LegacyPaymentService
    {
        public bool ProcessPayment(string cardNumber, decimal amount, string currency)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Legacy Service: Processing ${amount} {currency} payment using card ending in {cardNumber.Substring(cardNumber.Length - 4)}");
            // Simulate processing time
            Thread.Sleep(500);
            Console.WriteLine("Legacy Service: Payment processed successfully");
            return true;
        }
    }

    // Our application's payment interface
    public interface IPaymentProcessor
    {
        Task<PaymentResult> ProcessPaymentAsync(PaymentRequest request);
    }

    public class PaymentRequest
    {
        public string CardNumber { get; set; }
        public decimal Amount { get; set; }
        public string Currency { get; set; }
        public string MerchantId { get; set; }
    }

    public class PaymentResult
    {
        public bool IsSuccess { get; set; }
        public string TransactionId { get; set; }
        public string ErrorMessage { get; set; }
    }

    // Adapter to bridge the gap
    public class LegacyPaymentAdapter : IPaymentProcessor
    {
        private readonly LegacyPaymentService _legacyService;

        public LegacyPaymentAdapter(LegacyPaymentService legacyService)
        {
            _legacyService = legacyService;
        }

        public async Task<PaymentResult> ProcessPaymentAsync(PaymentRequest request)
        {
            try
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Adapter: Converting modern request to legacy format");

                // Convert our interface to legacy interface
                var success = await Task.Run(() =>
                    _legacyService.ProcessPayment(request.CardNumber, request.Amount, request.Currency));

                return new PaymentResult
                {
                    IsSuccess = success,
                    TransactionId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
                    ErrorMessage = success ? null : "Payment failed"
                };
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                return new PaymentResult
                {
                    IsSuccess = false,
                    ErrorMessage = ex.Message
                };
            }
        }
    }

    //Program.cs
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("=== Adapter Pattern Demo ===");

            // We have a legacy payment service we need to integrate
            var legacyService = new LegacyPaymentService();

            // Use adapter to make it compatible with our interface
            IPaymentProcessor paymentProcessor = new LegacyPaymentAdapter(legacyService);

            // Create payment requests
            var request1 = new PaymentRequest
            {
                CardNumber = "1234567812345678",
                Amount = 99.99m,
                Currency = "USD",
                MerchantId = "MERCHANT_001"
            };

            var request2 = new PaymentRequest

                Currency = "EUR",
                MerchantId = "MERCHANT_002"
