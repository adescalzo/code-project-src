summary: |
  This article provides a comparative analysis of Newtonsoft.Json and System.Text.Json, two prominent JSON serializers in .NET. It details the strengths of Newtonsoft.Json, such as its maturity and rich features, against System.Text.Json's advantages in performance and native integration within the .NET ecosystem. The comparison includes practical C# code examples for basic serialization and deserialization using both libraries. Furthermore, the article presents simplified benchmark results, indicating System.Text.Json's superior performance. The author concludes by recommending System.Text.Json for new projects due to its efficiency and lack of external dependencies, while advising against migrating legacy projects heavily reliant on Newtonsoft.Json.

> Have you been caught in the dilemma of choosing between Newtonsoft.Json and System.Text.Json for your .NET project? This article will provide a side-by-side practical comparison with code samples to assist you in making a choice!

So, you are up creating an app using .NET and you‚Äôre one of those who hate working with JSON files-such a common task. You‚Äôve found two of the most used libraries for this work: Newtonsoft.Json (sometimes referred to as Json.NET) and the built-in System.Text.Json. Which one will you choose? Not a ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù situation; hence the selection would depend on the specific need of the project. So, let‚Äôs dive right in (or not too deep, promise!).

## ‚è±Ô∏è**Newtonsoft.Json: The Old Timer**

`Newtonsoft.Json` is a well-established library. It‚Äôs very mature and rich-featured, and has a very large community, hence, many online resources, tutorials, and easy to access solutions for any problem you might run into. It isn‚Äôt limited to that; it‚Äôs also customizable, with advanced features such as built-in converters and attribute-based serialization.

The above is a simple case :

```csharp
// Using Newtonsoft.Json  
using Newtonsoft.Json;  
public class Person  
{  
    public string Name { get; set; }  
    public int Age { get; set; }  
}  
public class Example  
{  
    public static void Main(string[] args)  
    {  
        Person person = new Person { Name = "Alice", Age = 30 };  
        string json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(person);  
        Console.WriteLine(json); // Output: {"Name":"Alice","Age":30}  
        Person deserializedPerson = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Person>(json);  
        Console.WriteLine(deserializedPerson.Name); // Output: Alice  
    }  
}  
```

## üéØ**One limelight-gain in this context is System.Text.Json.**

It‚Äôs the own Microsoft-built-in JSON serializer, provided in .NET Core 3.1, `System.Text.Json`. It is faster, lighter, and more directly integrated into the .NET ecosystem. Better still, since this is a built-in serialzier, developers don‚Äôt need to use any external NuGet packages, thereby lightening the load from any angle for the sake of the project.

This is the same example in System.Text.Json:

```csharp
// Using System.Text.Json  
using System.Text.Json;  
public class Example  
{  
    public static void Main(string[] args)  
    {  
        Person person = new Person { Name = "Bob", Age = 25 };  
        string json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(person);  
        Console.WriteLine(json); // Output: {"Name":"Bob","Age":25}  
        Person deserializedPerson = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Person>(json);  
        Console.WriteLine(deserializedPerson.Name); // Output: Bob  
    }  
}  
```

## ü•áü•àü•âPerformance Comparison (Simplified):

This has actually been very simplified into performance comparison**.**

Usually, `System.Text.Json` enhances speed, particularly for huge data sets. However, with its rich set of features, `Newtonsoft.Json` may use some minimal overhead in performance. But the real difference will depend much more on the data and usage patterns. It‚Äôs a case of benchmarking.

Performance Comparison benchmark :

```csharp
//JsonSerializerDeserializer.cs  
[Benchmark]  
public void NewtonsoftSeralizeAndDeserialize()  
{  
    Person person = new Person { Name = "Alice", Age = 30 };  
    string json = Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.SerializeObject(person);  
    Console.WriteLine(json); // Output: {"Name":"Alice","Age":30}  
    Person deserializedPerson = Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Person>(json);  
    Console.WriteLine(deserializedPerson.Name); // Output: Alice  
}  
  
[Benchmark]  
public void SystemTextJsonSeralizeAndDeserialize()  
{  
    Person person = new Person { Name = "Bob", Age = 25 };  
    string json = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Serialize(person);  
    Console.WriteLine(json); // Output: {"Name":"Bob","Age":25}  
    Person deserializedPerson = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Person>(json);  
    Console.WriteLine(deserializedPerson.Name); // Output: Bob  
}
```

It lists mean execution times for Newtonsoft.Json and System.Text.Json serialization/deserialization, with System.Text.Json showing a lower mean (377.3 us) compared to Newtonsoft.Json (383.9 us).](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*GW4qfp1sy8hLtMa9MXRKwg.png)

üèÖ`System.Text.Json` (SystemTextJsonSeralizeAndDeserialize) is winner here. its Mean values less than `Newtonsoft.Json` (NewtonsoftSeralizeAndDeserialize).

![Cropped bar chart visually representing the performance comparison, with a partially visible text "System.Text.Json is better" at the top. The bars indicate System.Text.Json has a lower value, implying better performance.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:374/1*62H7rkv0UhLgLy5hKJKUxg.png)

In my opinion, `System.Text.Json` is really a good choice for new projects unless you require advanced features that Newtonsoft.Json provides. The performance gain with no external dependencies makes it an attractive option. If the legacy project already depends heavily on Newtonsoft.Json, migration isn‚Äôt worth it.

The best JSON serializer always depends upon your case.

`Newtonsoft.Json` has undying flexibility and a matured ecosystem.

`System.Text.Json` has the fast and straightforward built-in way.

Consider performance needs, dependencies that exist, feature requirements, and the scope of your project, and only then decide.

What is your own opinion on the topic or which serializer are you using and why?
