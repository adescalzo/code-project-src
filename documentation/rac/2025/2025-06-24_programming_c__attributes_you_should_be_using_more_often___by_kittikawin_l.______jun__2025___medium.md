summary: |
  This article explores seven essential C# attributes that can significantly improve code quality, readability, and maintainability. It demonstrates the practical application of `[Obsolete]` for deprecating code, `[Required]`, `[Range]`, and `[StringLength]` for streamlined data validation. The post also covers `[Serializable]` for object serialization, `[DebuggerDisplay]` for enhanced debugging, and `[CallerMemberName]` for simplified logging. Finally, `[Authorize]` is discussed for access control in ASP.NET Core, and `[JsonPropertyName]` is presented for flexible JSON property mapping with `System.Text.Json`.

# C# Attributes You Should Be Using More Often | by Kittikawin L. üçÄ | Jun, 2025 | Medium

Attributes in C# are a powerful but often overlooked feature. While you‚Äôve likely used **\[Obsolete\]** or **\[Required\]** before, the .NET ecosystem has **many built-in attributes** that can make your code smarter, cleaner, and easier to maintain.

In this post, I‚Äôll explore **essential** C# **attributes** that every developer should have in their toolkit, and how they can save you time and headaches.

# 1. \[Obsolete\] ‚Äî Warn Others Not to Use It

You‚Äôve written a method that shouldn‚Äôt be used anymore, but you don‚Äôt want to break legacy code just yet?

```csharp
[Obsolete("Use NewMethod instead.")]  
public void OldMethod()  
{  
    // legacy code  
}  
  
// the obsolete program element as an error., default is `false`  
[Obsolete("Use CallNewMethod instead.", true)]  
public void CallOldMethod()  
{  
    // legacy code  
}
```

‚úÖ **Pro Tip**: Add **true** as a second parameter to make an **error**, not just a warning.

# 2. \[Required\], \[Range\], \[StringLength\] ‚Äî Validate Without Writing Code

These **data annotation attributes** are perfect for ASP.NET and models.

```csharp
public class User  
{  
    [Required]  
    public string Name { get; set; }  
  
    [Range(1, 100)]  
    public int Age { get; set; }  
  
    [StringLength(10, ErrorMessage = "PhoneNumber cannot be longer than 10 characters.")]   
    public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }  
}
```

üìå No need to write extra validation logic, frameworks like **ASP.NET Core MVC** pick this up automatically.

# 3. \[Serializable\] ‚Äî Enable Simple Object Serialization

Used when you want to mark a class as serializable for binary or XML persistence:

```csharp
[Serializable]  
public class Person  
{  
    public string Name { get; set; }  
}
```

üîç Works well with older .NET serialization APIs.

# 4. \[DebuggerDisplay\] ‚Äî Cleaner Debug Info

Tired of seeing confusing object outputs in the debugger?

```csharp
[DebuggerDisplay("Name = {Name}, Age = {Age}")]  
public class Person  
{  
    public string Name { get; set; }  
    public int Age { get; set; }  
}
```

üí° Instantly improves your debugging experience in Visual Studio.

# 5. \[CallerMemberName\] ‚Äî Better Logging & Notifications

Want to know which method triggered a property change or log entry?

```csharp
public void Log(string message, [CallerMemberName] string caller = "")  
{  
    Console.WriteLine($"{caller}: {message}");  
}
```

üôå Useful for **logging**, **INotifyPropertyChanged**, and tracing.

# 6. \[Authorize\] ‚Äî Handle Access Control in ASP.NET

Used in ASP.NET Core to **enforce authentication** and **role-based access**:

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]  
public IActionResult AdminDashboard()  
{  
    return View();  
}
```

‚úÖ Plug-and-play **access control** for your **APIs** and **controllers**.

# 7. \[JsonPropertyName\] ‚Äî Customize JSON Output

Working with _System.Text.Json_ and need to map property names?

```csharp
public class Product  
{  
    [JsonPropertyName("product_name")]  
    public string Name { get; set; }  
}  
  
// Map property name from "Name" to "product_name"
```

üöÄ Great for working with APIs where **naming conventions don‚Äôt match your C# code**.

# Takeaway

These little annotations are powerful, whether you‚Äôre improving your **readability**, data **simplification**, or adding **runtime logic**, attributes are key parts of writing **maintainable modern C#**.
