summary: |
  This article advocates for migrating from the legacy `.sln` solution file format to the new XML-based `.slnx` format in .NET projects. It highlights the long-standing issues with `.sln`, such as cryptic GUIDs and frequent merge conflicts, which hinder team collaboration and CI/CD pipelines. The `.slnx` format offers improved human readability, easier diffing, and better integration with CLI tools and modern IDEs like Visual Studio and JetBrains Rider. The author provides practical steps for creating new `.slnx` files or migrating existing `.sln` files using .NET SDK commands, emphasizing the benefits for developer experience and team velocity.

# Stop using `.sln` files ‚Äî switch to `.slnx` in .NET (yes, now!) üöÄ

The old `.sln` served us well, but the new XML-based `.slnx` fixes decades of pain ‚Äî fewer merge fights, better tooling, and CLI-first workflows. Here‚Äôs why you should consider migrating today (and how to do it painlessly). ‚ú®

# TL;DR

`.slnx` is an XML-based solution file format that modernizes the legacy `.sln`. It‚Äôs now supported by Visual Studio, the .NET SDK/CLI, MSBuild and third-party IDEs ‚Äî which means fewer GUID headaches, easier diffs, and smoother CI. Migrate using `dotnet sln migrate` or `dotnet new sln --format slnx`. üëá

# Why `.sln` has been annoying for years ü•¥

The classic `.sln` format is essentially a bespoke blob: lots of GUIDs referencing GUIDs, cryptic layout sections, and frequent, nasty merge conflicts when multiple people touch the solution file. That made `.sln` hard to read, edit, and maintain outside Visual Studio ‚Äî and it often became a bottleneck in team workflows.

# Meet `.slnx`: what it is and why it matters üå±

`.slnx` is a new, **XML-based** solution format designed to replace the legacy `.sln`. It was created to be readable, tool-friendly, and easier to diff and merge. Tooling support is coming together: **Microsoft Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider** and the .NET SDK/CLI can create, read, and build `.slnx` files, and third-party IDEs (like JetBrains Rider) are already adding support. **In short:** it‚Äôs the modern, maintainable version of the solution file.

```xml
<Solution>
  <Configurations>
    <Platform Name="Any CPU" />
    <Platform Name="x64" />
    <Platform Name="x86" />
  </Configurations>
  <Project Path="my-app/my-app.csproj" />
</Solution>
```

# The practical benefits (real-world wins) ‚úÖ

*   **Fewer merge conflicts:** XML structure and clearer references make diffs meaningful and conflicts simpler to resolve.
*   **Human-readable:** You can open and understand a solution file without wrestling with GUID lists.
*   **CLI + build friendliness:** `dotnet` tooling can operate on `.slnx` the same way it does `.sln` ‚Äî generate, migrate, build. That makes automation and CI pipelines cleaner.
*   **Easier cross-tool support:** With a standard, documented XML schema, editors and tooling can interoperate without hacks.

# When not to rush a migration ‚ö†Ô∏è

*   If you‚Äôre pinned to an older Visual Studio or SDK that lacks support, hold off until your toolchain is updated. (But check your SDK ‚Äî recent .NET SDKs and Visual Studio previews already support `.slnx`.)
*   Big mono-repo with specialized tooling? Test the migration in a branch and run CI thoroughly ‚Äî don‚Äôt flip the whole repo overnight.

# How to try it today ‚Äî step-by-step üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-slnx-support-dotnet-cli/](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-slnx-support-dotnet-cli/)

**1\. Create a fresh** `**.slnx**`

```bash
# new empty solution in slnx format
dotnet new sln --format slnx -n MySolution
```

**2\. Migrate an existing** `**.sln**`

With .NET SDK 9.0.200 or greater, use:

```bash
# creates a .slnx version from your existing .sln
dotnet sln migrate
```

Or use `saveAs` on your favorite IDE after enabling the `**.slnx**` feature.

**3\. Build from** `**.slnx**`

```bash
dotnet build ./MySolution.slnx   # Explicitly target the .slnx file
# or
dotnet build                     # Implicitly builds the only solution file in the folder
```

(These commands are supported in recent .NET SDK releases and integrate with `dotnet` CLI workflows.)

# A tiny migration checklist for teams üß∞

*   Create a **migration branch** and run `dotnet sln migrate` on your main solution.
*   Run **all tests in CI** with the `.slnx` file.
*   Ensure developers **update to a supported VS/SDK version** (document the minimum).
*   Add a short note to **PR templates** reminding reviewers that `.slnx` diffs are expected.
*   Keep a **rollback plan** ‚Äî you can still use `.sln` if you need to revert.

# What about editing `.slnx` by hand? ‚úçÔ∏è

Yes ‚Äî `.slnx` is XML, so it‚Äôs easier to edit in a text editor or script programmatically. But don‚Äôt treat it like a replacement for proper tooling: prefer `dotnet sln` commands or your IDE for adding/removing projects to avoid mistakes.

# Final pitch: less pain, more velocity üéØ

If you value **readable repos**, **fewer merge conflicts**, and tooling that plays nicely with CI and editors ‚Äî `.slnx` is not a gimmick. It‚Äôs a practical upgrade for the .NET ecosystem.

Try it on a small solution, prove it in CI, then roll it out team-wide.
Your **future self** (and your teammates) will thank you. üôå
