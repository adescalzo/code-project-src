# Difference between Class and Structure in C#

In C#, both classes and structures (structs) are powerful tools for defining custom types, but they behave quite differently under the hood. Understanding their differences is crucial for writing efficient, maintainable, and performant code.

## 🔍 Reference vs Value Types

At the core, the most fundamental difference is how memory is allocated:

*   Classes are reference types. Instances are allocated on the heap, and variables hold references (pointers) to those instances.
*   Structs are value types. They are usually stored on the stack or inline in containing types, and are copied by value, meaning each copy is independent.

### 💡 Example: Reference vs Value Semantics

```csharp
// Class: Reference type
public class Person
{
    public string Name;
    public int Age;
}

Person p1 = new Person { Name = "Alice", Age = 30 };
Person p2 = p1;
p2.Age = 31;
Console.WriteLine(p1.Age);

// Outputs 31 — same object
```

```csharp
// Struct: Value type
public struct Point
{
    public int X;
    public int Y;
}

Point a = new Point { X = 10, Y = 20 };
Point b = a;
b.X = 99;
Console.WriteLine(a.X);

// Outputs 10 — independent copy
```

| **Performance**     | May incur GC overhead; better for large objects      | Faster to copy; better for short-lived, small data |

## 🛠️ Use Cases: When to Use Structs vs Classes

### ✅ Use a **Struct** When:

*   The data type is small (generally ≤16 bytes)
*   It is immutable
*   You don’t need inheritance or polymorphism
*   You want performance optimization and reduced memory pressure (avoiding heap allocations)
*   Examples: Point, Vector2, DateTime, Color, MoneyAmount

### ✅ Use a **Class** When:

*   You need to inherit or extend behavior
*   You are dealing with large or mutable objects
*   Reference sharing is necessary (e.g., two variables referencing the same object)
*   You require finalizers, polymorphism, or interfaces
*   Examples: Employee, Customer, Stream, Controller, DbContext

## 🔄 Behavior in Practice

Let’s look at another class and struct example to visualize real-world usage:

### 🧑‍🏫 Class Example: Author

```csharp
public class Author
{
    public string Name;
    public string Language;
    public int ArticleCount;
    public int RevisionCount;

    public void ShowDetails()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Author: {Name}\nLanguage: {Language}\nArticles: {ArticleCount}\nRevisions: {RevisionCount}");
    }

    public static void Main()
    {
        Author author = new Author
        {
            Name = "Ankita",
            Language = "C#",
            ArticleCount = 80,
            RevisionCount = 50
        };

        author.ShowDetails();
    }
}
```

### 🚗 Struct Example: Car

```csharp
public struct Car
{
    public string Brand;
    public string Model;
    public string Color;
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Car car;
        car.Brand = "Bugatti";
        car.Model = "Veyron EB 16.4";
        car.Color = "Gray";

        Console.WriteLine($"Brand: {car.Brand}\nModel: {car.Model}\nColor: {car.Color}");
    }
}
```

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

*   Structs avoid garbage collection if used wisely, making them faster in high-performance, short-lived scenarios (like game development or numeric processing).
*   However, large structs (>16 bytes) can degrade performance due to copying cost.
*   Misusing structs (e.g., making them mutable or using them for complex types) can lead to hard-to-find bugs.

## ✅ Best Practices

*   Use structs only for simple, short-lived, immutable data.
*   Keep struct size small to avoid expensive copies.
*   Avoid complex behavior or polymorphism in structs.
*   Use classes if you need inheritance, shared state, or large objects.

## 📌 Summary

| Choose **Struct** for:                 | Choose **Class** for:                  |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| Lightweight, immutable data            | Complex, mutable objects               |
| High-performance, low-allocation scenarios | Scenarios requiring polymorphism       |
| Small objects like points, colors, and records | Objects with long lifetimes or shared state |

Understanding when and why to choose between class and struct can help you write **more efficient, maintainable**, and **cleaner C# code**. Pick wisely based on your use case, and you’ll avoid performance pitfalls and unnecessary complexity.

*   **Struct Mutability and Performance**: Discuss scenarios where mutable structs can lead to unexpected behavior and performance issues. How does defensive copying apply here?
    
    Mutability in structs can introduce subtle bugs, especially when they are passed around or stored in collections. Because structs are value types, each time they are assigned, a copy is created. If a struct is mutable, modifying one copy won't affect the others, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the developer expects shared state. Furthermore, frequent modification of large structs can degrade performance significantly due to the overhead of copying. Defensive copying involves creating a new copy of a struct to prevent unintended modifications to the original struct. It is a technique used to avoid the issues that arise when a struct is modified in place, and these changes inadvertently affect other parts of the application. When working with mutable structs that are passed as parameters or returned from methods, defensive copying ensures that the original data remains unchanged, preventing potential bugs. The tradeoff is the cost of copying; while this cost is relatively low.
    
*   **Choosing Between `class` and `struct`**: Beyond the guidelines, discuss real-world scenarios and design considerations that influence the decision between using a `class` or a `struct`.
    
    The choice between `class` and `struct` extends beyond simple guidelines and depends on specific design considerations and real-world scenarios. While structs are generally preferred for small, immutable data, the decision is not always straightforward. Consider a scenario where you're modeling a complex object with mutable state and relationships to other objects. In such cases, a class is often a better choice because it supports inheritance, polymorphism, and shared references, allowing for more flexible and extensible designs. For example, in a game development scenario, a `GameObject` class might be used to represent entities in the game world. This class would likely have mutable properties like position, rotation, and scale, and it would also have relationships to other game objects, such as parent-child relationships. Using a class allows for easy management of these relationships and the sharing of state between objects. Another example is modeling a user session in a web app.
    
*   **Garbage Collection and Structs**: Explain how structs help in reducing Garbage Collection overhead and the impact on application performance.
    
    Structs, being value types, play a significant role in reducing Garbage Collection (GC) overhead, positively impacting application performance. Unlike classes, which are reference types allocated on the heap, structs are typically stored on the stack or inline within their containing types. This fundamental difference affects how memory is managed and contributes to the reduction of GC pressure. When objects are allocated on the heap (as with classes), the GC is responsible for reclaiming the memory occupied by those objects when they are no longer referenced. This process, while necessary for managing memory, introduces overhead in terms of CPU time and can cause pauses in application execution. By using structs, we can often avoid heap allocation altogether. When a struct is created, its memory is allocated on the stack, which is automatically reclaimed when the struct goes out of scope. This eliminates the need for the GC to track and collect these objects, reducing the overall GC.
    
*   **Boxing and Unboxing with Structs**: Describe the boxing and unboxing process of structs and their performance implications. What are the best practices to avoid unnecessary boxing?
    
    Boxing and unboxing are processes that occur when converting between value types (like structs) and reference types (like `object`). Boxing is the conversion of a value type to a reference type, while unboxing is the reverse process. These operations have performance implications due to the extra overhead involved. When a struct is boxed, a new object is allocated on the heap, and the value of the struct is copied into this object. The original struct remains unchanged. This boxing operation requires memory allocation and data copying, which can be expensive, especially if performed frequently. Unboxing involves checking that the boxed object is actually of the correct value type and then copying the value from the heap back to a struct on the stack. This operation also incurs overhead due to the type checking and data copying. The performance implications of boxing and unboxing can be significant, especially in performance-critical sections of code. Unnecessary boxing can lead to.
    
*   **Structs and Interfaces**: Explore the implications of structs implementing interfaces. How does explicit interface implementation affect performance and boxing?
    
    When a struct implements an interface, certain considerations arise regarding performance, particularly related to boxing and unboxing. Structs, being value types, are typically stored on the stack. When a method on an interface implemented by a struct is called through an interface reference, the struct may be boxed. This is because the interface reference is a reference type, and the struct must be converted to a reference type before the method can be invoked. This boxing operation incurs overhead, as it involves allocating memory on the heap and copying the struct's data. Explicit interface implementation can affect performance and boxing in several ways. When a struct explicitly implements an interface method, the method is only accessible through the interface reference. This means that calling the method directly on the struct will result in a compiler error. The advantage of explicit interface implementation is that it can prevent unintended calls to the interface method.
