summary: |
  This article provides a comprehensive guide to mastering configuration management in .NET using the Options pattern. It delves into the distinctions between `IOptions<T>`, `IOptionsSnapshot<T>`, and `IOptionsMonitor<T>`, explaining their unique behaviors regarding configuration loading and refresh mechanisms. The author clarifies when to use each interface based on whether configuration needs to be static, updated per request, or updated in real-time with notifications. Through practical examples, the guide helps developers make informed decisions for building flexible and robust ASP.NET Core applications.

# Mastering `IOptions` in .NET ‚Äî The Complete Guide to `IOptions<T>`, `IOptionsSnapshot<T>`, and `IOptionsMonitor<T>`üöÄ

![Flowchart illustrating the differences between IOptions<T>, IOptionsSnapshot<T>, and IOptionsMonitor<T> in .NET configuration. IOptions<T> is Singleton, reads configuration once, and does not refresh on change. IOptionsSnapshot<T> is Scoped, reads configuration once per request, and refreshes per request. IOptionsMonitor<T> is Singleton, reads configuration whenever it changes, and provides real-time notifications for changes.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*IeApiywjzEG0LvJ2tOBzHQ.png)

A few days ago, I was watching an NDC conference talk, and the speaker casually mentioned something I‚Äôd seen before but never really explored: `IOptions<T>`, `IOptionsSnapshot<T>`, and `IOptionsMonitor<T>`.

I‚Äôd used `IOptions<T>` in my ASP.NET Core projects plenty of times, but I‚Äôll admit it ‚Äî I never stopped to think:

*   Why are there _three_ different ‚Äúoptions‚Äù interfaces?
*   How exactly do they differ?
*   When should I use one over the others?

That talk made me realize how many developers (my past self included) just pick one, make it work, and move on ‚Äî without understanding what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes.

So, I decided to dig in. And here‚Äôs the practical guide I wish I had years ago.

## Why the Options Pattern Exists

ASP.NET Core introduced the **Options pattern** to avoid hardcoding configuration values and instead bind them to strongly typed C# classes.

Instead of this:

```csharp
var apiKey = Configuration["MyConfig:ApiKey"];
```

You do this:

```csharp
public class MyConfig
{
    public string ApiKey { get; set; }
    public int Timeout { get; set; }
}

builder.Services.Configure<MyConfig>(
    builder.Configuration.GetSection("MyConfig"));
```

Type-safe, cleaner, and less error-prone. But here‚Äôs the twist:
What happens if your configuration **changes while the app is running**?

Do you need a restart?
Do you want updates per request?
Do you want instant notifications?

That‚Äôs where the three flavors come in.

### 1. `IOptions<T>` ‚Äî The Immutable Classic

Key Facts:

*   Configuration is read once at startup.
*   No updates after app starts.
*   Works anywhere ‚Äî singleton scoped or transient services.

```csharp
public class MyStaticService
{
    private readonly MyConfig _config;

    public MyStaticService(IOptions<MyConfig> options)
    {
        _config = options.Value;
    }

    public string GetApiKey() => _config.ApiKey;
}
```

**When to use:**
When your settings are fixed for the entire app lifetime (e.g., app name, fixed API base URL).

### 2. `IOptionsSnapshot<T>` ‚Äî Scoped Refresh

Key Facts:

*   Reads configuration **once per request**.
*   Only works in **scoped** or **transient** services.
*   Doesn‚Äôt send change notifications.

```csharp
public class MyScopedService
{
    private readonly MyConfig _config;

    public MyScopedService(IOptionsSnapshot<MyConfig> options)
    {
        _config = options.Value;
    }

    public int GetTimeout() => _config.Timeout;
}
```

**When to use:**
For web apps where configuration can change between requests (e.g., per-tenant settings, feature toggles).

### 3. `IOptionsMonitor<T>` ‚Äî Real-Time Updates + Notifications

Key Facts:

*   Reads configuration whenever it changes.
*   Works in **singleton** and **scoped** services.
*   Supports `OnChange()` for callbacks.

```csharp
public class MySingletonService
{
    private MyConfig _config;

    public MySingletonService(IOptionsMonitor<MyConfig> options)
    {
        _config = options.CurrentValue;
        options.OnChange(updated =>
        {
            _config = updated;
            Console.WriteLine("Configuration changed!");
        });
    }

    public string GetApiKey() => _config.ApiKey;
}
```

**When to use:**
When you need real-time updates in long-running services (e.g., background jobs, live feature switches).

## Final Thoughts

When I first heard about `IOptionsSnapshot<T>` and `IOptionsMonitor<T>` in that NDC talk, I realized I‚Äôd been treating all ‚Äúoptions‚Äù the same. But in reality:

*   `**IOptions<T>**` ‚Üí static settings.
*   `**IOptionsSnapshot<T>**` ‚Üí per-request updates.
*   `**IOptionsMonitor<T>**` ‚Üí real-time changes + notifications.

Choosing the right one isn‚Äôt just about code correctness ‚Äî it‚Äôs about making your app flexible without adding complexity where it‚Äôs not needed.

Next time you wire up configuration in ASP.NET Core, you‚Äôll know exactly which ‚Äúoptions‚Äù to pick.
