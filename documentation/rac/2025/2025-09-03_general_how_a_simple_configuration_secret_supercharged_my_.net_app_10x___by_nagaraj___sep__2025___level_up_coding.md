> Optimize your .NET Core application speed by up to 10x using multifaceted compression, sophisticated caching, and advanced connection management. All the techniques are documented with code snippets.

**Did your .NET Core app ever feel like it’s crawling through molasses?**

_I’ve been there — watching my app lag under pressure, frustrating users, and driving me up the wall_.

But here’s the kicker: I slashed its response time by 10x without touching a single line of code. Let me walk you through .net core new features and show you exactly how to get speed screams with .net core configuration tweaks that actually work. No fluff, just relief steps for your performance pain.

🔸Shrinking the amount of data sent over the network leads to shorter response times. Payloads can be shrunk with .NET Core compression, such as Gzip or Brotli, which requires no additional coding.

*   **Add compression middleware:** Bring `Program.cs` up to speed by integrating response compression.
*   **Choose the right algorithm:** Brotli codecs have better compression rates than Gzip codecs.
*   **Configure MIME types:** Compress generic formats such as JSON and HTML.

> Compressions are essentially the most efficient suitcase packing.

🔸Inefficient connection handling can bottleneck your application’s throughput. Optimizing HTTP client settings alongside connection pooling in .NET Core leads to better resource efficiency.

*   **Use HttpClientFactory:** Avoids the exhaustion of sockets by reusing established connections.
*   **Set connection limits:** Increase `MaxConnectionsPerServer` for highly accessed APIs.
*   **Enable Keep-Alive:** Decrease latency by using TCP connections.

_Connection pooling is nothing other than carpooling for HTTP requests-each intended to cause fewer trips and thereby reduce advances._

🔸Caching stores frequently accessed data, slashing response times. .NET Core’s built-in caching mechanisms, like in-memory caching, are simple to implement.

*   **Use IMemoryCache:** Keep only the small, frequently accessed data in memory.
*   **Set expiration policies:** Balance the freshness vs performance concern with the use of sliding or absolute expiration.
*   **Cache at the right layer:** Cache API server responses or database responses.

> Caching is something similar to grabbing a hot cup of coffee ready before waking up, thus keeping a few quick seconds to perform a life-saving job.

🔸The garbage collection (GC) process can temporarily halt your app, resulting in a performance hit. Optimizing the GC settings in .NET Core reduces the frequency and duration of these interruptions.

*   **Use Server GC:** Targets high-throughput-for scenarios.
*   **Adjust GC frequency:** Use `GCLatencyMode.SustainedLowLatency` to manage the delay in pauses, which may be considered by the user.
*   **Monitor memory usage:** Use tools like Application Insights to track GC impact.

**In .csproj :**

**In program.cs:**

> Like cleaning your home, GC tuning lessens pauses, making the system run smoothly.

### **Performance Considerations** ⚡

Not all tweaks are suitable for all applications; a subsequent questioning of these components is suitable under drafting of optimal fixes.

*   **Workload type:** Compressions deliver benefits when the payload of a transmission is large and not so much when small.
*   **Scalability needs:** Connection pooling is a crucial feature for apps handling high-concurrency overviews.
*   **Memory constraints:** Juggle caching with the existing RAM in order to ward off swapping.
*   **Monitoring:** Measure the impact of changes with a profiling tool.

> Performance enhancement is akin to walking a tightrope — you need to know your application’s requirements to avoid over-optimization.

### 🔍 In a Nutshell

*   **Compression shrinks payloads** —Fast network transfers with a minimum of preparation.
*   **Connection management boosts throughput** — High drive in resource consumption.
*   **Caching delivers instant responses** —If optimum payload is preferred, data should be strategically stored.
*   **GC tuning reduces pauses** — Eliminate results of runtime interruptions.
