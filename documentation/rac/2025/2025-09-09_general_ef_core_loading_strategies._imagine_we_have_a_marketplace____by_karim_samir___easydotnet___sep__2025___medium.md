summary: |
  [This article explains the three primary data loading strategies in EF Core: Lazy, Eager, and Explicit Loading. It uses a Marketplace application scenario with Stores, Products, and Owners tables to illustrate each concept. For each strategy, the post provides practical C# code examples demonstrating its implementation, along with the corresponding SQL queries generated by EF Core. The content highlights how each loading method impacts data retrieval and database interactions, offering insights into when to use each approach for optimal performance.]

**RELATED** OBJECTS(DATA)

Imagine we have a Marketplace application.
So we have Stores Table and Products Tables, and this last one is linked with a foreign key to Stores table.
And also we have Owners table linked with Store table.

- We have one interface show just Stores Data like name, address, location, and phone, _without products data_: **Lazy Loading**
- One interface show All Stores + count of products for each store: **Eager Loading**
- One Interface show All Stores + if a stores is premium, we show phone number of owner (from Owners Table): **Explicit Loading**

## Practical:

**LAZY Loading:** load automatically **when accessed**

```csharp
var store = await context.Stores.FirstAsync(s => s.Id == 1);
  
// ðŸš¨ query happens *automatically* when accessed  
var products = store.Products;
```

```sql
/*  
SQL generated for store:  
SELECT   
[s].[Id], [s].[Name], [s].[Address], [s].[Location],   
[s].[Phone], [s].[OwnerId]  
FROM [Stores] AS [s]  
WHERE [s].[Id] = @id;  
*/
```

For Lazy Loading, itâ€™s Important to add this in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
// EF Core with Lazy Loading proxies  
services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options =>  
    options.UseLazyLoadingProxies().UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
```

**EAGER Loading:** load what you need **Immediately**

```csharp
var stores = await _db.Stores  
        .Include(s => s.Products) // eager load products  
        .ToListAsync();
```

```sql
/*  
SQL generated:  
SELECT [s].[Id], [s].[Name], [s].[Address], [s].[Location], [s].[Phone],  
       [p].[Id], [p].[Name], [p].[StoreId]  
FROM [Stores] AS [s]  
LEFT JOIN [Products] AS [p] ON [s].[Id] = [p].[StoreId];  
  
-- All stores and their products are loaded in a single query.  
*/
```

**EXPLICIT Loading:** load **only when you want**

```csharp
var stores = await _db.Stores.ToListAsync(); // Load stores only  
  
foreach (var store in stores)  
{  
    if (store.IsPremium)  
    {  
        // Explicitly load the owner only for premium stores  
        await _db.Entry(store).Reference(s => s.Owner).LoadAsync();  
    }  
}
```

```sql
/*  
SQL generated:  
  
-- Load stores  
SELECT   
[s].[Id], [s].[Name], [s].[IsPremium], [s].[OwnerId]  
FROM [Stores] AS [s];  
  
-- Explicitly load owners only for premium stores (example: 2 premium stores)  
SELECT [o].[Id], [o].[Name], [o].[Phone]  
FROM [Owners] AS [o]  
WHERE [o].[Id] = @ownerId1;  
  
SELECT [o].[Id], [o].[Name], [o].[Phone]  
FROM [Owners] AS [o]  
WHERE [o].[Id] = @ownerId2;  
*/
```
