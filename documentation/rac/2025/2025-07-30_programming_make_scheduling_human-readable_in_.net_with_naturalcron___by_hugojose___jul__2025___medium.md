summary: |
  This article introduces NaturalCron, an open-source .NET library designed to simplify the creation and understanding of scheduled tasks. It addresses the common difficulty of interpreting traditional cron expressions by allowing developers to define schedules using human-readable strings. The library also provides a fluent builder API for type-safe schedule construction. NaturalCron aims to reduce errors and improve readability in task scheduling within .NET applications, offering features like weekday lists and time windows.

Cron expressions are powerful but notoriously hard to read. If youâ€™ve ever looked at something like:

`0 18 * * 1â€“5`

and had to pause to figure out what it means, youâ€™re not alone. Cron syntax works, but itâ€™s **cryptic** and easy to mess up.

# Why is this a problem?

Cron is great for defining schedules, but:

*   Itâ€™s **not intuitive** (who remembers what the fifth asterisk means?).
*   It **requires a cheat sheet** for most people.
*   One small mistake can cause jobs to run at the wrong time (or not at all).

Developers often resort to online generators just to make sure theyâ€™re writing it correctly.

# Meet NaturalCron

NaturalCron is an **open-source .NET library** that replaces cryptic cron syntax with **human-readable scheduling expressions**.

Instead of memorizing strange symbols, you can write:

`every day between mon and fri at 18:00`

Readable schedules reduce mistakes, **write expressions that you can understand at a glance**.

# Quick Start

## Using a Human-Readable Expression

```csharp
using System;  
using NaturalCron;  
  
string expression = "every day at 18:00";  
  
// Parse and calculate next occurrence (local time)  
NaturalCronExpr schedule = NaturalCronExpr.Parse(expression);  
DateTime next = schedule.GetNextOccurrence(DateTime.Now);  
  
Console.WriteLine($"Next occurrence: {next}");
```

## Using Fluent Builder

```csharp
using System;  
using NaturalCron;  
using NaturalCron.Builder;  
  
NaturalCronExpr schedule = NaturalCronBuilder  
    .Every(30).Minutes()  
    .In(NaturalCronMonth.Jan) // Only one month supported for now  
    .Between("09:00", "18:00")  
    .Build();  
  
DateTime next = schedule.GetNextOccurrenceInUtc(DateTime.UtcNow);  
  
Console.WriteLine($"Next occurrence in UTC: {next}");
```

# Why choose NaturalCron?

âœ” **Fluent Builder API**: Type-safe for .NET developers.  
âœ” **Extra features**: weekday lists, time windows, month filters.  
âœ” **Open-source**: Free to use and contribute to.
