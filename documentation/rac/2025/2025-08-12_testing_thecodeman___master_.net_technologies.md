## Refit - The .NET Rest API you should know about

August 12 2025

##### When Rest API Client is mentioned in .NET, most of us think and most of us use HttpClient which is excellent.

##### But did you know that there is something better that is also easier to implement?

##### Have you heard of Refit?

##### Let's see what it's all about.

   
 

### What is Refit?

   
 

##### [Refit](https://github.com/reactiveui/refit) is a REST API client library for .NET that allows you to define an API as an interface in your application.

##### With Refit, you use attributes to define HTTP requests, making it a breeze to call RESTful services.

##### Built on top of System.Net.Http.HttpClient, Refit takes care of the heavy lifting, including serialization and deserialization of JSON data, allowing you to focus on writing your business logic.

##### Let's take a look on the example.

   
 

### Example: Public GitHub Api

   
 

##### In the example, we will use a simple **GitHub Public Api**.

##### The GitHub API is a great example for demonstrating how to use Refit due to its rich set of features and documentation.

##### Let's create a simple client that fetches user information from GitHub.

##### **Step 1: Add nuget package Refit.HttpClientFactory:**

```csharp
dotnet add package Refit.HttpClientFactory
```

##### **Step 2: Define the GitHub API Interface**

##### First, define an interface that represents the GitHub API endpoints you're interested in.

##### For this example, we'll fetch user details from the GitHub API.

##### Create a new file **IGitHubApi.cs** in your project:

```csharp
using Refit;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public interface IGitHubApi
{
    [Get("/users/{username}")]
    Task<GitHubUser> GetUserAsync(string username);
}
```

##### Here, we use the **\[Get\]** attribute to specify that GetUserAsync will perform an HTTP GET request to the _/users/{username}_ endpoint.

##### **Step 3: Define the GitHub User Model**

##### Next, create a model that represents the JSON response returned by the GitHub API. Create a new file _GitHubUser.cs_:

```csharp
public class GitHubUser
{
    public string Login { get; set; };
    public string Name { get; set; };
    public string Company { get; set; };
    public int Followers { get; set; };
    public int Following { get; set; };
    public string AvatarUrl { get; set; };
}
```

##### This class defines the properties we want to extract from the GitHub API response.

##### **Step 4: Configure Dependency Injection for Refit**

##### Now, let's configure Dependency Injection (DI) for Refit in the Program.cs file:

##### Open Program.cs and modify it as follows:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddRefitClient<IGitHubApi>()
    .ConfigureHttpClient((sp, client) =>
    {
        var settings = sp.GetRequiredService<IOptions<GitHubSettings>().Value;

        client.BaseAddress = new Uri(settings.BaseAddress);
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Authorization", settings.AccessToken);
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("User-Agent", settings.UserAgent);
    });
```

##### builder.Services.AddRefitClient() registers the Refit client with DI.

##### This sets up IGitHubApi as a **typed client**, which **Refit will generate for you**.

##### GitHubSettings represents the settings presented via the IOptions pattern, whose values are mostly found in appsettings.json.

##### And that's it, it is necessary to call the method on the API endpoint where you need it.

```csharp
var user = await gitHubService.GetUserAsync("StefanTheCode");
```

   
 

### What benefit do you actually get from this?

   
 

##### If you were to implement this using HttpClient, it would be necessary to create a class that implements IGitHubApi and that somehow uses HttpClient in the GetUserAsync method to call the API and get the data.

##### It would roughly look like this:

```csharp
public class GitHubApiClient : IGitHubApi
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public GitHubApiClient(HttpClient httpClient)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
        _httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://api.github.com");
    }

    public async Task<GitHubUser> GetUserAsync(string username)
    {
        var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync($"/users/{username}");

        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

        var user = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<GitHubUser>();

        return user;
    }
}
```

##### Here we see the advantages of Refit.

##### Instead of writing this much code, it is necessary to define only the interface and then **Refit will generate everything we need to call the Api endpoint in the background**.

##### Very useful isn't it?

   
 

### Benefits of Using Refit with .NET 8

   
 

##### By using Refit, we significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to make HTTP requests and handle responses.

##### This leads to:

##### **Improved Readability:** Your API interfaces are clearly defined and separate from the business logic, making the code easier to read and maintain.

##### **Easier Testing:** Since the API interactions are defined as interfaces, they can be easily mocked during testing.

##### **Seamless Integration**: Refit integrates smoothly with modern .NET features such as dependency injection, HttpClientFactory, and advanced serialization options, making it a perfect fit for .NET 8 projects.

   
 

### Conclusion

   
 

##### Refit is a powerful library that, when combined with .NET 8, offers a robust and streamlined approach to consuming REST APIs.

##### In just a few lines of code, we set up a GitHub API client, fetched user data, and displayed it in the console.

##### This simplicity, combined with .NET 8’s performance improvements and modern language features, makes Refit an excellent choice for developers looking to build efficient and maintainable applications.

##### That's all from me for today. Make a coffee and try Refit.
