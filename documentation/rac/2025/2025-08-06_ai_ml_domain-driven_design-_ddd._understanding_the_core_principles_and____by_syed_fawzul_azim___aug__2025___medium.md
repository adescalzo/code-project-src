# Domain-Driven Design- DDD. Understanding the Core Principles and… | by Syed Fawzul Azim | Aug, 2025 | Medium

# Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

## Understanding the Core Principles and Structure of Domain-Driven Design

Domain-Driven Design is a methodology and set of principles for developing software systems where the domain (the business logic) is the core concern.

It emphasizes collaboration between technical (software) and domain (business) experts to create a shared understanding, expressed through a **ubiquitous language**, which ensures the software reflects real-world business needs.

### Core Concepts of DDD:

**1. Domain:**

*   The problem space the software addresses.
*   **Example**: In an e-commerce system, the domain might include:
    *   Ordering
    *   Payments
    *   Shipping
    *   Inventory

**2. Ubiquitous Language**

*   Shared language used by developers, domain experts, and stakeholders to describe the domain consistently.
*   **Example**: Instead of saying “`invoice generator`” in code and “`order confirmation`” in meetings, the team agrees to use **“Order Confirmation”** everywhere.

**3. Bounded Context**

*   A specific boundary where a domain model is consistent and unambiguous.
*   **Example**:
    *   _Ordering_ context has `Order`, `OrderItem`, `OrderService`.
    *   _Shipping_ context has `Shipment`, `DeliveryStatus`, `TrackingService`.

Each context has its own understanding of terms like “Order”.

**4. Domain Model**

*   The conceptual model of the domain that includes both behavior and data, expressed in code.
*   **Example:**
    An `Order` object that includes business logic such as:
    *   `addItem()`
    *   `calculateTotal()`
    *   `placeOrder()`

**5. Entities**

*   An object with a unique identity and lifecycle.
*   **Example**: A Customer entity with a unique `customerId`. It has attributes like `name` and `email` and behaviors like `updateAddress()`. The Customer persists across orders and is tracked over time.

**6. Value Objects**

*   Immutable objects are defined by their attributes, without a unique identity. They are _attributes_ of Entities.
*   **Example**: An `Address` value object with attributes like street, city, and zip code. Two addresses with identical values are considered equal, and it’s immutable to ensure consistency.

**7. Aggregates**

*   A cluster of entities and value objects with one entity as the aggregate root, ensuring consistency.
*   **Example**: `Order` is an aggregate root. It contains `OrderItems`, and all changes must go through `Order`.

**8. Repositories**

*   A mechanism to access and persist aggregates.
*   **Example**: An `OrderRepository` retrieves and saves `Order` aggregates to a database, not for internal entities or value objects.

**9. Domain Events**

*   Something that happened in the domain that we want to track or react to.
*   **Example**: An `OrderPlaced` event is published when a customer confirms an order. You might use this to trigger:
    *   `Email notification`
    *   `Stock reservation`

**10. Services**

*   Stateless domain operations that don’t belong to a single entity or value object.
*   **Example**: A `PaymentService` coordinates payment processing by interacting with an external payment gateway and updating the Order status.

**11. Context Mapping**

*   Defines relationships between bounded contexts to manage integration.
*   **Example**: _Ordering_ and _Shipping_ have different models but must interact.
    Relationships can be defined as:
    *   Customer/Supplier (Shipping depends on Ordering)
    *   Conformist (Shipping adapts to Ordering’s model)
    *   Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) to prevent direct model leak

### Strategic vs tactical patterns:

![Comparison of Strategic Design concepts (e.g., Bounded Context, Ubiquitous Language) and Tactical Patterns (e.g., Entities, Aggregates, Repositories) in DDD.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*52TYvsqPaRfxqlhgJxHELw.png)

**Strategic Patterns**

Focus on the big picture: defining Bounded Contexts and how they interact (Context Mapping). They guide how different parts of a system and teams collaborate, ensuring clear boundaries and integration.

**Tactical Patterns**

Focus on the inside of a bounded context: modeling the domain with Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Repositories, and Domain Services to organize business logic clearly and maintainably.

![Concentric Layers of a DDD Architecture showing Presentation, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:564/1*mDqBwkqUuRHIT3ONEJtMWQ.png)

**Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic and domain model (entities, value objects, aggregates, domain services, Repository Interfaces).

**Application Layer**: Coordinates tasks and use cases by invoking domain objects; it doesn’t contain business logic itself.

**Infrastructure Layer**: Implements technical details like database access, messaging, file systems, or external APIs.

**Presentation Layer**: Handles user input/output (e.g., REST controllers, UI, CLI) and communicates with the application layer.

**Dependency Rule:** All layers depend inward (Infrastructure → Application → Domain).

![Diagram illustrating dependencies between Application, Domain Model, and Infrastructure layers within a Microservice in DDD, along with their responsibilities.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*t890m1r4IBkpTfgoNvKUAg.png)

Key Rules for the Domain Layer:

*   It is pure business logic — no database, no HTTP, no frameworks.
*   It should not depend on any other layer (e.g., infrastructure, presentation).
*   It expresses the Ubiquitous Language shared by developers and business experts.

**Every Domain Object is either an entity or a value object.**

![Diagram illustrating the composition of Domain Objects, showing Entities and Value Objects, and how they form Aggregates.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*Tw3X1b0BkYvJK_Hgu6kM2Q.png)

*   An _entity_ has a unique identifier (ID).
    If two entities have the same ID, they are considered equal, even if their other attributes differ.

*   A _value object_ has no identity.
    If two value objects have the same attribute values, they are considered equal.

**Example:**

Below is a sample payload representing a customer placing an order with two items:

```json
{
  "customerId": "c123", // Entity ID: Reference to the Customer Entity

  "shippingAddress": {  // Value Object: Address has no identity, defined by its attributes
    "street": "Hauptstr. 12",
    "city": "Frankfurt",
    "zipCode": "60313",
    "country": "Germany"
  },

  "items": [ // Collection of OrderItem Entities (part of the Order Aggregate)
    {
      "productId": "p101",
      "productName": "Mechanical Keyboard",
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": {
        "amount": 120.00,
        "currency": "EUR"
      }
    },
    {
      "productId": "p202",
      "productName": "Wireless Mouse",
      "quantity": 2,
      "price": {
        "amount": 40.00,
        "currency": "EUR"
      }
    }
  ],
  "paymentMethod": "CREDIT_CARD"
}
```

**Aggregate Design:**

*   `Order` is the Aggregate Root, `Customer` Aggregate, `Product` Aggregate
*   `CustomerId` and `ShippingAddress` are part of the `Order` aggregate.
*   `OrderItem` (with `ProductId`, quantity, and price) is an Entity or Value Object, depending on your use case.
*   `Price` is a Value Object.

Do not embed:

*   Full `Customer` or `Product` data in `Order`
*   Because these are separate aggregates, possibly owned by other teams or services
*   Helps with independent lifecycle and transaction boundaries

Only include:

*   Reference (ID) to other aggregates

### Common ways to implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD):

1.  **Tactical DDD**
    Use core building blocks like Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Repositories, and Domain Services within a bounded context.
2.  **Strategic DDD**
    Define Bounded Contexts and Context Maps to organize large systems and manage relationships between different domain models.
3.  **Layered Architecture (Hexagonal/Ports & Adapters)**
    Separate concerns into Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers with clear dependency rules.
4.  **Modular Monolith**
    Structure a monolithic app into modules representing bounded contexts for easier maintenance and future scaling.
5.  **Event-Driven Architecture**
    Use Domain Events to decouple aggregates and bounded contexts via asynchronous messaging.
6.  **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
    Separate write and read models for optimized performance and scalability.
7.  **Event Sourcing**
    Persist changes as a sequence of events rather than the current state, allowing full auditability and replay.
8.  **Clean Architecture**
    Combine DDD with Clean Architecture’s concentric layers to enforce strict boundaries and testability.
9.  **Onion Architecture**
    Organizes the system in concentric layers centered on the domain model, keeping business logic independent from infrastructure and UI, enforcing dependency inversion.

Domain-Driven Design helps bridge the gap between business and software by placing the domain model at the center of the development process. By using concepts like entities, value objects, aggregates, and bounded contexts, DDD enables teams to build software that closely reflects real-world business needs. With a clear separation of concerns and a shared language across teams, DDD not only improves code quality but also enhances collaboration and long-term maintainability.
